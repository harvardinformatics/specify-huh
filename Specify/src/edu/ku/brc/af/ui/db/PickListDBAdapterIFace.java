/**
 * There are three types of PickLists:<br>
 * 1) A PickList that uses values from the PickListItems table meaning the PickList object is managing all the items.<br>
 * 2) A PickList that uses the entire table, which really means it is return all the records as items in the PickList and they are formatted using the DataObjectFormatter<br>
 * For example, a list the DeterminationStatus.<br>
 * 3) A PickList that uses the values from an arbitrary table and it should search on a field. It returns a list of objects that are formatted with a DataObjectFormatter.
 * 
 * Note: Any Class implementing this interface so it can be used in the ValComboBox must also implement ComboBoxModel!
