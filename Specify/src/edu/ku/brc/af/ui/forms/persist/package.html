This package contains all the data classes that are needed to read and write form definitions. The UI forms definitions are kept in one or more 
"View Set" files (See the forms.xsd for the XML Schema.) Each file has a View Set name and each form in the View Set has an integer ID. 
This means any form can reference and other form in the system with the View Set name and the Id.
<br><br>Note that SubView can reference Forms outside of it's own View Set, but Alternative Forms can only reference forms within its View Set. 
This could easily be changed if necessary.<br><br>n this case a "form" is really the definition of a form. The form's object hierarchy
is used to creates the forms using Swing UI objects. 
<br>
<br>
Really need to change this all over to using a factory approach and eliminate the "types" then anything can be place inside a form.
