This package contains the <i>core</i> portion of of the app that enables taks to reqister themselves and provide services for the rest of the application, as well as,
 the navigation panel.<br>
A main functionality component is called a Task and must implement the Taskable interface.
<br><br>

<b>Overview</b>
<p>
The screen of the application is divided into two areas: 1) The Navigation pane 2) The 'main' pane area. The navigation area will contain
one or more NavBoxes, each NavBox contains a set of logically grouped items. These items are usually command to perform some task or display
information. Sometimes they represent a passive object like a set of references to records called RecordSets.</p>
<p>
A Task represents a main component of functionality in the system. When a Task is registered it is asked for any toolbar components, 
menu items, and Nav Boxes. It will also create (vend) a 'default' or 'main' panel for itself that will appear in the main panel area, 
which is typically on the right hand side of the screen. When a new task is created the "context" switches to the new task. The default 
way of displaying (or allowing) multiple tasks is to have a TabbedPane for each task. Additional panes may be displayed when the user 
clicks on a command in a NavBox, the "sub panes" have the same Task context as the Task that created them.

As stated eariler, the NavBoxes are created by the task and typically call back to the Task to have their commands processed. For example, 
the Statistics Task will create a NavBox with commands for creating and displaying various different Bar Charts. When the user clicks on 
the command button the Stats Task receives the request and asks the ContextMgr
