<h2>Import Data Overview</h2>
<p>The WorkBench can easily create a Data Set and import  data from an <a href="ImportXLS.html">MS Excel</a>  or  <a href="ImportCSV.html">CSV</a> (comma separated value) file. </p>
<p>The WorkBench   'maps' the  column headings from the import file to fields in the Specify 6 data model. This is not only necessary for other features in the WorkBench to function properly, but also ensures that the data will uploaded correctly into Specify 6. The WorkBench includes an 'auto-mapping' feature that reads the import column headings and attempts to automatically map them to any matching fields. Any ' unmapped' column headings      can be manually mapped. The column headings could be mapped to different Specify fields at any later stage by <a href="EditMapping.html">editing the Data Set Mapping</a>. </p>
<p>The Data Set will display the imported column headings rather than the Specify fields, as these are more familiar. </p>
<p>If data exists on several scanned card images or field notes, it is very helpful to create a Data Set by <a href="ImportImages.html">importing the images</a>. </p>
<p>The WorkBench can also import images as a batch and link scanned images to individual rows in a Data Set.</p>
