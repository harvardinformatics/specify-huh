       User-Defined Pick Lists
    </h2>
    <p>
       Any field in which data is limited to a controlled vocabulary is called a <em>Pick
      List</em>. For example, Specify ships with the Agent Title field limited to the choices of
      Asst. Director, Curator, Dr., Mr., Mrs., and Ms.
    </p>
    <p>
       New user-defined pick lists can be created for existing fields but the field on the affected
      form will not be updated until the form itself has been edited. For this reason pick lists
      should NOT be defined until the new form containing the pick list has been imported into
      Specify. If pick lists are defined without being included in the existing form, data entered
      into the existing form will not be saved in the database.
    </p>
    <p>
       At this time Specify 6 does not include a Form Editor, as was found in Specify 5. It is
      important to note that the forms have been created programmatically to be extremely flexible
      and can be exported as XML and either edited locally by an experienced XML editor, or emailed
      to the Specify staff for customization assistance. To export a form please refer to <a href=
      "../Import/import_export.html">Importing/Exporting</a>. If you have an ISA agreement and wish
      to have a member of the Specify team edit the form please contact them at <a href=
      "mailto:specify@ku.edu">specify@ku.edu</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
       Pick lists that are defined within Specify are called system pick lists. New pick lists
      created by the user are referred to as User- Defined Pick Lists. The following text describes the
      steps to create a user-defined pick list. For information about system pick lists, please
      refer to <a href="../PickList/system_picklist.html">System Pick Lists.</a>    </p>
    <p>Any pick list changes are reflected in the current collection only. The release of Specify 6.3 allowed pick lists to be exported and imported, allowing quick sharing among collections and collecting communities. This feature also allows the Specify team to create and share pick lists at the same time they create custom forms. More information about <a href="../PickList/Pick_List.html#picklist_import">importing and exporting Pick Lists </a>can be found in the text below. </p>

      <p>
        Add, delete and edit the pick lists in the Pick List Editor found in <em>System &gt; Schema
          Configuration.</em> The Schema Configuration tool is only available to users in a manager or administrator group.
      </p>

        <li>
          Choose English as the language.
        </li>
<br />
        <li>
          Click the <em>Edit a Schema</em> button.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Schema Configuration tool will open.

          Choose a field from the list of fields.
        </li>

       <strong><a name="add_picklist" id="add_picklist">Add a Pick List</a></strong>    </h3>
<blockquote>
      <p>
        To add a new pick from within the pick list editor, leave the second combo box as 'none' and click the (...) button.      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Choose the <img height="16" alt="a" src="../../images/add.png" width="16"> (add) button.        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A second dialog will open to configure the pick list. There are three types of pick lists,
        all with different configurations:      </p>
      <p>
        1. <u>User Defined Items</u> is a predefined list. Items in this type of pick list are either
        created by the user (controlled vocabulary) or created when values are typed into a field.      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          A Pre-defined pick list is very useful to control the exact data entered into a field. A good
          example of this is Type Status Name in the determinations form. Anyone entering
          determinations is limited to the same set of data choices.        </p>
        <p>
          To create a <strong>predefined list of items</strong>:        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            choose <strong><em>User Defined Items</em></strong> from the Type drop down menu.          </li><br />

          <li>
            Type a name in the <strong>Name</strong> text box.          </li><br />
 
          <li>
            Check the <strong><em>Read Only</em></strong> check box.          </li><br />

          <li>
            click the <img height="16" alt="a" src="../../images/add.png" width="16"> (add) button in
            the Items section.          </li><br />

          <li>
            <strong>Type a Title</strong>  will appear on the form.          </li>
          <br />
	
          <li>
            <strong>Type a Value</strong>  is stored in the data base. It is a good practice
            not to use spaces. The Value exists so that at a later date the Title can be edited without
            needing to change the value in the data base.          </li>
		  <br />
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use a  pick list that is created as values are typed into the  field  when  a controlled list  is required but but it is also necessary to allow users to enter new values.        </p>
        <p>
          To create a <strong>pick list that is created from entered data</strong>:        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use the steps above, but <strong>Do Not</strong> check the <strong>Read Only</strong> box.          </li><br />
          <li><strong>Size Limit</strong> field - limits the number of values in the pick list. Once the list has reached this number of values the oldest value will
            be dropped from the list.
            <br>
      </li>
        </ul>
  </blockquote>
      <p>
        2. <u>Entire Table</u> allows all values in a formatted table to be listed. This is a useful
        tool when the field needs to link to an entire record but the list of values is small and a
        Query Combo box is not necessary.      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          To create an <strong>Entire Table</strong> list:      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Choose <em>Entire Table</em> from the Type combo box.        </li>
       <br />
          <li>
            Type a name for the pick list in the Name text box.        </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Choose a Table from the Table Name combo box.        </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Choose a Formatter from the Formatter box; this typically will offer only a single choice.              </li>
        </ul>
  </blockquote>
      <p>
        3. <u>Field From Table</u> uses the values from a field within a table. Creating a pick list
        from a field is only feasible when there will be a small number of values. If the number
        exceeds 12 it is suggested that the field be linked to a Query Combo Box within the form
        rather than a pick list.      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          To create a <strong>Field From Table</strong> list:      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Choose <em>Field From Table</em> from the Type combo box.        </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Type a name for the pick list in the Name box.        </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Choose a Table from the Table Name combo box.        </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Choose a Formatter from the Formatter box -- in most cases there will not be more than one
            choice for this.        </li>
         <br />
          <li>
            Choose a field from the Field Name combo box.        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once the pick list has been created, it will need to be linked to the field.      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Click the second combo box (currently displaying 'None').        </li>
        <br />
          <li>
            Choose the pick list name from the list.        </li>
