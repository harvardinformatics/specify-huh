<h2>Edit Taxon Node Values </h2>
<p>Nodes to the Taxon tree are added using the Taxon form. The Taxon form includes fields from the Taxon table such as Name, Parent, Rank, Common Name, Source, Author, synonym information, Child Taxa and Taxon Citations. Required fields include Name, Parent and Rank.</p>
<p>Hybrid names are created by combining the Hybrid Parent 1 field and the Hybrid Parent 2 field, which are also included on this form.</p>
<p>Ichthyology Taxon forms also include a button that opens the Taxon information in the Fishbase web service.</p>
<p>Nodes can not be moved using this form. To move a node drag and drop the node onto a new parent, then click on the <em>Move </em>button in the resulting dialog.</p>
