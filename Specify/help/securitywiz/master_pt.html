This form allows you to test the validity of your Specify ‘Master’ username and password.  
If the username or password specified are incorrect, you can try additional possibilities.  
Finally, if you are unable to determine the correct username and password, both can be reset with this tool to new values.  
Resetting the Specify ‘Master’ username and password should only be done as a final option because doing so will force the 
recreation every user password for the database.   
If you reset the Master username and password, all user accounts will immediately be unable to access the database until each user key is re-created.
</p>
<p>
After resetting the ‘Master’ username and password, a window will appear which allows the choice of which collection 
databases will be assigned the new ‘Master’ username and password.  
It is very important to select only the database(s) that will be using the new 
‘Master’ username and password, otherwise users of other Specify databases on your server (if any) 
will be locked out of accessing Specify data until each of their individual user encrypted password keys are recreated.
