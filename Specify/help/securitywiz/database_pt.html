<p>
This form allows you to test the validity of the Specify “IT” username and password.  
Typically the Specify “IT” user is either the ‘root’ user of the MySQL database server with all rights.  
In institutions with database administration or IT support, the IT user name and password may only be known 
to the system or database administrator.
</p>  
<p>
For small and single-user installations of Specify, the “IT” user name and 
password would have been specified during the original installation of MySQL as the database engine behind Specify.  
If you are unable to validate your “IT” username and password strings here, this tool will not be usable.
