<h2><img src="../../images/data_split_32.png" width="32" height="32" /> Specify File Splitter</h2>
<p>There are times that users may wish to upload MS Excel files that contain more than the 4000 records, which is the record limit for the Specify Uploader. For user convenience, the Specify project has created an application, the <em>Specify File Splitter</em>, that will split files that contain more than 4000 records into files that contain only 4000 records. </p>
<p>The <em>Specify File Splitter</em> application is located in the <strong><em>bin</em></strong> directory within the Specify application directory, which stores the executable files for Specify. Double click<em> Specify File Splitter</em> to launch the tool. Users are required to login using their  Specify Username and Password. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>File to Split</strong>; click the <em>Choose</em> button and find the desired file using the file directory. </p>
  <p><strong>First row contains headers</strong>; check this box if the first row of the file contains headers. Specify will then copy the headers to each 4000 record file. If the files include headers they will contain 4001 records, but Specify does not count header files when uploading.</p>
  <p><strong>Lines per File</strong> refers to the number of rows in the CSV file. This defaults to 4000 but can be any number desired. If a number greater than 4000 is entered a warning message will appear. If you are splitting the file to import it into the WorkBench you should not exceed 4000 rows, as that is the maximum number of rows allowed in an import.</p>
  <p> click the <em>Slice</em> button to start the File Splitter. The new files use the original file name but add an underscore and consecutive number for each file. The original file remains intact. For example: A file named &quot;Birds.xls&quot; containing 34002 rows will be split into 17 files containing 4000 rows and 1 file containing 2 rows. The files will be named &quot;Birds_1.xls&quot; thru &quot;Birds_18.xls&quot;. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> When headers are not used in the MS Excel files each file will need to be remapped in the template editor inside the WorkBench. If headers are present then only the first file will need to be mapped and  subsequent files are given the option of using the existing mapping.</p>
