<h2><img src="../../images/spwizard32.png" width="32" height="32" /> Specify Setup Wizard</h2>

<p>The Specify Setup Wizard is required to customize the necessary components in MySQL for communication with Specify. It walks you through the creation of a database including; the insertion of a schema within MySQL, the creation of an administrative level  Specify user, and the initialization of the database structure. It also allows you to download the start of Taxon and Geography authority files.</p>
<p>Before running the Specify Setup Wizard to create a blank database for the full Specify application,   Java and MySQL must be installed. MySQL must include  an administrative (root) login account with all MySQL permissions.</p>
<p>The Setup Wizard should NOT be run if a collection data already exists in Specify. It creates a new, blank database and will permanently erase all 
existing data. The Wizard should only be run one time, for the initial Specify installation and setup, then can be deleted from your computer. If Specify 
will be installed on a network server and run on several computers, the Setup Wizard should only be used to setup the database on the Network. DO NOT use the
 Setup Wizard on other computers, they only need to have Specify installed.</p>
<p>Fields within the Wizard that must contain data before continuing to the next step in the Wizard are displayed in <strong>bold</strong> font.</p>
<h4>MySQL requirements for creating a Specify database and Master credentials using the Specify Wizard</h4>
<p>The first   Wizard window creates a blank Specify database within MySQL and inserts the schema (empty tables, fields and relationships) for the database. The second Wizard window creates a Specify Master username and password. The Specify Wizard can <strong>NOT</strong> be used to perform these two tasks if:</p>

<ol type="I">
  <li> The default data management engine for an existing MySQL installation is NOT InnoDB.</li>
  <li>The Specify Setup will be on a dedicated server, or desktop computer accessed by other desktops.</li>
  <li>You wish to create your own database rather than use the Wizard to create the Specify database and insert the schema.</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>I. </strong>The default data management engine for an existing MySQL installation is NOT InnoDB.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>If your default MySQL engine is not InnoDB it can be changed using the guidelines found on the Specify website at: <a href="http://specifysoftware.org/content/changing-default-mysql-engine-innodb">http://specifysoftware.org/content/changing-default-mysql-engine-innodb</a>. </li>
    <p>OR</p>
    <p>If you are unable to change your default MySQL engine, you will need to create a blank Specify database   with MySQL's software tools and insert a Specify schema <em>before</em> running the Specify Setup Wizard. The Specify team provides both an explanation and script for performing these tasks from within MySQL on the Specify website at: <a href="http://specifysoftware.org/content/creating-specify-database-within-mysql">http://specifysoftware.org/content/creating-specify-database-within-mysql</a>. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The MySQL step-by-step installation guide, located on the Specify web site, prompts users to designate InnoDB as the default data storage engine.  Institutions with legacy installations of MySQL may have originally configured  their system for a different data engine and may not be able to change the default storage engine to InnoDB; in this case, do not run the Wizard you have created a black Specify database using MySQL software tools and inserted a Specify schema. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <li> Once a Specify database is created using the MySQL software tools and a schema inserted by running the provided script, run the  Specify Wizard  to create other necessary components of the database. </li><br />
    <li> When running the Specify Wizard, rather than creating the database and inserting the schema in the first Wizard window, you will verify that Specify can access your existing database and schema in the <em>Advanced</em> section by clicking on the <em>Test IT Login</em> button. </li><br />
    <li>When accessing the database locally, the Wizard can be used to create the Specify Master by clicking the <em>Create Master User</em> on the second Wizard window. </li>
    <p>OR</p>
    <p>When accessing the database remotely please follow the steps in procedure #2 below.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </ol>
  
  <p><strong>II.</strong> The Specify Setup will be on a dedicated server, or desktop computer accessed by other desktops.</p>
  
    <ol>
    <li>If the Specify database will be accessed by other 'client' computers you will first need to manually create a Specify Master username and password in MySQL before running the Specify Wizard. Instrucions for setting up the Specify Master username and password in MySQL can be found on the Specify website at: <a href="http://specifysoftware.org/content/specify-system-setup">http://specifysoftware.org/content/specify-system-setup</a>.</li><br />
    <li>After reading the information on the website and creating the Specify Master username and password in MySQL, run the  Specify Wizard and enter the MySQL information on the first Wizard screen and click the <em>Create Specify Database</em> button to create the database and insert the schema (unless you have created a database using the MySQL tools in procedure #1 above). </li><br />
    <li>On the second Specify Wizard window enter the Specify Master credentials, then click the <em>Test Master Login</em> button to verify that the Specify Master credentials were created from within MySQL.</li>
    
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p><strong>III.</strong> You wish to create your own database rather than use the Wizard to create the Specify database and insert the schema.</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>If you wish to create your own Specify database and insert a schema from within MySQL rather than using the Specify Wizard, the Specify team provides both an explanation and script for performing this task from within MySQL on the Specify website at <a href="http://specifysoftware.org/content/creating-specify-database-within-mysql">http://specifysoftware.org/content/creating-specify-database-within-mysql</a>. </li><br />
    <li>Once you have read the provided information and created your Specify database and inserted the schema, run the Specify Wizard. </li><br />
    <li>On the first Wizard window, rather than creating the database and inserting the schema,  verify that Specify can access your existing database and schema in the <em>Advanced</em> section by clicking on the <em>Test IT Login</em> button. </li><br />
    <li>When accessing the database locally, the Wizard can be used to create the Specify Master by clicking the <em>Create Master User</em> on the second Wizard window. </li>

<p align="center"><span class="imgcaption">Enter MySQL IT Username and Password</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The first window allows you to either create a Specify database or verify that Specify can access a database you have already created within MySQL. To create or verify a database, you must first complete the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>IT Username</strong> and <strong>IT Password</strong> must be an existing account with full administrator privileges in the MySQL database manager. This account will be used by the Specify Setup Wizard to create your Specify database and a Specify Master account (in the next window) in MySQL. If you do not know the IT administrator (&quot;root&quot;) account username and password for MySQL, or do not have a MySQL installation, exit now. You can not go further without these.    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Database Name</strong> will be used to name the database that the Setup Wizard is about to create. If you do not have an existing database but are using the Wizard to create one, you are creating this name as you type it into the window. Once you name the database make sure to document it so you can reference it if you need it at a later date.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If you have an existing database you must enter the name of the database in this text box so that the Wizard may verify that Specify can connect to the database before continuing with the Wizard. If you are testing an existing database be sure to click on the <em>Test IT Login</em> button to test the connection to your database. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Host Name</strong> is the name of the computer that is running MySQL. This is either an IP Address  or name of the computer that is recognized by the server. When running MySQL on your local machine this is almost always 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
      <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> When using an IP Address make sure that the IP is 'static'. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Create a Specify Database</strong>
        <blockquote>
          <p>When you click the <em>Create Specify Database</em> button Specify will connect to MySQL using the information you have entered, create your Specify database, and insert the Specify schema. If Specify can not connect to MySQL and build the database for any reason a message will display. To proceed in the Wizard you will need to verify that the information entered and your MySQL setup are correct.</p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Advanced: Test IT Login</strong>
        <blockquote>
          <p>If a Specify database exists withing MySQL you must verify it before proceeding in the Wizard. Enter your database information, then click the <em>Test IT Login</em> button in the Advanced section of the window. The Wizard will verify that Specify can connect to your existing database. If Specify can not connect to the existing database you may not proceed within the Wizard using the existing database.</p>

<p align="center"><span class="imgcaption">Create a Master Username and Password</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The security system for Specify 6 uses both a &quot;Master&quot; username and password, which Specify uses to access  the MySQL Database, as well as a User username and password, which allows a user to run the Specify program. The Master account has SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,  DELETE and TABLE LOCK privileges on data tables in your Specify database only and has no other MySQL privileges. Specify uses only one Master username and password for all users, but encrypts the Master password with the User information, creating an encrypted string. This allows the Master information to become unique for each user. </p>
  <p>This window either creates the Master username and password for your Specify system, or verifies that a Master username and password that has already been created within MySQL is recognized by Specify. Any instance of Specify that does not access MySQL on the local machine, (uses a remote server), must create the Master username and password using the MySQL Admin. tool. Instructions for setting up the Specify Master username and password in MySQL can be found on the Specify website at<a href="http://specifysoftware.org/content/specify-system-setup"> http://specifysoftware.org/content/specify-system-setup</a>.</p>
  <p>When creating the Master username and password, the word &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;Root&quot; SHOULD NOT BE USED. Please create a unique Master username and  a secure, strong password for it. This should not be the same as the username and password used for the MySQL IT account in the previous window. This information should be remembered and secured by the person installing MySQL and Specify at your institution. The Specify administrator,  (a role and  account within Specify), will need the Master username and password to create new user accounts in Specify. </p>
  <p>Also, the &quot;Master&quot; username and password should not be used as a Specify user account name within Specify.  Whichever username and password you choose for the Master account, that username and password is never used to log in to Specify. This &quot;Master&quot; username and password should ALWAYS be unique. Do not use this username and password for any other accounts in MySQL or Specify.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Create the Master</strong></p>
    <p>When you click the <em>Create Master User</em> button Specify will take a moment to create the Master account in the database. Once this account has been created you may not change the information on this screen, or  any previous screens.</p>
    <p><strong>Advanced: Test the Master</strong></p>
    <p>Click the <em>Test Master Login</em> button to verify that Specify can connect to the Specify database using the existing master credentials that you have previously created in the MySQL command line tool. </p>

  <p align="left">Specify Security refers to the set of permissions and entitlements within Specify which gives users the rights to see certain data and to use particular functions. If your Specify database will never have more than one user, (you), then Security (i.e. permissions within Specify), can be turned off. This will give you total access to all Specify program functions and data. Specify will not check your credentials or limit your access to data or Specify components.</p>
  <p align="left">If you will be creating multiple users within Specify it is recommended that you turn security on. </p>

It is this username and password that will be used to log in to Specify for the first time, once this Setup Wizard is finished. At that time additional users can be added within Specify. </p>
  <p>Protect the username and make the password strong. This Specify manager level information will  also be used to create a record in the Specify database for an &lsquo;Agent&rsquo; representing the same person. </p>

<p align="center" class="imgcaption">Choose Accession Level</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Accessioning is the formal process by which a specimen or object is legally accepted and recorded as a museum item and differs from cataloging.  Some museums and herbaria have a formal accessioning process, some do not. If your institution does not use the concept of accessions (typically handled by a registrar or administrative curator), then leave this item unchecked and simply click the <em>Next</em> button to proceed to the next window.</p>
  <p align="left">For organizations that do recognize accessions, the process usually entails documenting  proof of ownership (in the form of a signed deed of gift), and that the material was legally acquired (in the form of all associated permits - collecting, import and export). An accession usually covers an entire field trip and multiple catalog items could be included within a single accession.  For the institutions that use it, accessioning and its associated numbering system is usually set up as a standard museum-wide process, backed by policy.  </p>
  <p align="left">The accession numbering scheme or sequence can either be recorded  at an Institution level for all collections (Globally) or at a Division level. The way to do this within Specify is based on whether your institution has  staff which manage all accession transactions for your institution, like a Registrar, or if accessions and accession numbers will be managed and assigned  within one or more separate Divisions within the Institution.  Again, if you do not use accessions, this choice can be ignored.  Assigning accessions to be managed &quot;globally&quot; across the entire organization will ensure that accession numbers and records are unique across all collections for the entire institution.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> If you choose to manage your accessions globally you will be presented with the following window to choose a format. If you did not choose to manage your Accessions globally you will be presented with the window later in the Wizard process when you create a Collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Specify Wizard not only defines the Taxon tree but also allows pre-loading of an authority file for the discipline you are creating. <span class="style2">Authority files were created using data from the </span> Catalog of Life Project for some of the disciplines within Specify. If this window does not appear, there are no existing authority files for your chosen discipline. </p>
  <p>If  you choose to load the data into your tree the Taxon tree  will be populated with hundreds of taxon nodes and all associated data. Then, when adding Collection Objects into your database you can simply choose a taxon from the Taxon field rather than adding each individually as needed.</p>
  <p>Please note that loading the Taxon tree will also affect the tree definition. If you load the provided Taxon authority file for your discipline the accompanying tree definition may include Levels that were not defined by you in the previous window, but are necessary to include all the predefined Taxon information.</p>
  <p>Additional discipline-specific trees can be loaded from within Specify at the time new disciplines are created.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <strong><em>Choose</em></strong> button for a list of taxon files for the discipline you are creating. Not all disciplines offer more than one taxon file. Once the taxon file is chosen, information will display in the <strong>Source</strong>, <strong>Coverage</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> fields for that file. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Botany and Entomology authority files represent partial trees due to the size of these files. Contact  Specify at <strong>specify@ku.edu</strong> for additional authority files. </p>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>The<strong> Downloadable File</strong> section in this window allows you to choose taxon files from your hard drive. The Setup Wizard can only install files that were downloaded from the Specify website. The Specify team is currently in the process of creating more of these files.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Specify is able to accept data for  collection objects or observations without assigning a Catalog Number. But when Catalog Numbers are used, they must be unique for each lot, specimen or observation.  Most collections routinely assign catalog numbers to  incoming materials, perhaps as part of the accessioning process. These numbers may require a format with specific sections for data such as Institution Code and year or they may simply use an incrementing number.</p>
  <p>Catalog Numbers can either be unique to each Collection, shared by several collections or be used throughout the Institution. The Catalog Number chosen at this time will not affect where it is used relative to other collections, this will be configured from within the Specify application. The Catalog Number format for this collection can not be edited once it is chosen.</p>
  <p>Several formats are  available from the drop-down menu list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong align="left">Format</strong> offers several choices in the drop-down menu list:
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><strong>None</strong> is the default setting, which is a 60 character string field.</p><br />
        <p align="left"><strong>Create</strong> allows you to create your own format. Choosing Create will open the Field Formatting Editor. Click <a href="../Security/Field_Format_Editor.html">HERE</a> for the Field Formatting Editor help page. </p><br />
        <p><strong>CatalogNumber</strong> (2009-######) The year will appear automatically in the first section (2009) of the format, and can also be manually edited inside Specify. The '###' section of the format is a number that is six digits in length. This section can be automatically incremented when Auto Numbering is turned on in Specify or manually entered when Auto Numbering is turned off. These two sections are separated by a dash.</p><br />
        <p><strong>CatalogNumberAlphaNumByYear</strong> (2009-######) The year will appear automatically in the first section (2009) of the format, and can also be manually edited from within Specify. The '###' section of the format is a number that is six digits in length. This section can be automatically incremented when Auto Numbering is turned on in Specify or manually entered when Auto Numbering is turned off. These two sections are separated by a dash.</p><br />
        <p><strong>CatalogNumberNumeric</strong> (#########) This is a nine digit number that is automatically incremented  when Auto Numbering is turned on in Specify or manually entered when Auto Numbering is turned off.</p><br />
        <p><strong>CatalogNumberString</strong> (XXXXXXXXXX) This is a ten digit string that can include numbers, alphabet or characters</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Is Numeric</strong> will display a 'yes' if the format is numeric.</li>
