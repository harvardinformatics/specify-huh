<p>The Specify Wizard is used to create a new, empty database within Specify. It walks you through the creation of a database and insertion of a schema within MySQL, the creation of an administrative level database and Specify user and the initialization of the database structure. It also allows you to download that start of Taxon and Geography authority files.</p>
<p>Before running the Wizard,   Java and MySQL must be installed. MySQL must include  an administrative (root) login account with all MySQL permissions.</p>
<p>The Setup Wizard should NOT be run if collection data already exists in Specify. It creates a new, blank database and will permanently erase all existing data. The Wizard should only be run one time, for the initial Specify installation and setup, then can be deleted from your computer.</p>
<p>Fields that must contain data before moving to the next Wizard window (required fields) are displayed with a <strong>bold</strong> font.</p>
<h4>MySQL requirements for creating a Specify database and Master credentials using the Specify Wizard</h4>
<p>The first   Wizard window creates a blank Specify database within MySQL and inserts the schema (empty tables, fields and relationships) for the database. The second Wizard window creates a Specify Master username and password. The Specify Wizard can <strong>NOT</strong> be used to perform these two tasks if:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The default data management engine for an existing MySQL installation is NOT InnoDB.</li>
  <li>The Specify Setup will be on a dedicated server, or desktop computer accessed by other desktops.</li>
  <li>You wish to create your own database rather than use the Wizard to create the Specify database and insert the schema.</li>
</ol>
<p>1. If your default MySQL engine is not InnoDB it can be changed using the guidelines found on the Specify website at <a href="http://specifysoftware.org/content/changing-default-mysql-engine-innodb">http://specifysoftware.org/content/changing-default-mysql-engine-innodb</a>. If you are unable to change your default MySQL engine, you will need to create a blank Specify database   with MySQL software tools and insert a Specify schema <em>before</em> running the Specify Setup Wizard. The Specify team provides both an explanation and script for performing these tasks from within MySQL on the Specify website at <a href="http://specifysoftware.org/content/creating-specify-database-within-mysql">http://specifysoftware.org/content/creating-specify-database-within-mysql</a>. </p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The MySQL step-by-step installation guide available on the Specify web site, specifies to make INNOdb the default data storage engine when installing Specify for the first time.  Institutions with legacy installations of MySQL may have had it configured originally for a different data engine, and in that case the Wizard should not be used to create a new Specify database in that installation of MYSQL, until after the above procedure and script is run. </p>
<p>When you are running the Wizard, rather than creating the database and inserting the schema in the first Wizard window, you will verify that Specify can access your existing database and schema in the <em>Advanced</em> section by clicking on the <em>Test IT Login</em> button. </p>
<p>2. If the Specify database will be accessed by other 'client' computers you will first need to manually create a Specify Master username and password in MySQL before running the Specify Wizard. Instructions for setting up the Specify Master username and password in MySQL can be found on the Specify website at<a href="http://specifysoftware.org/content/specify-system-setup"> http://specifysoftware.org/content/specify-system-setup</a>.</p>
<p>When running the Specify Wizard enter the MySQL information on the first Wizard screen and click the <em>Create Specify Database</em> button to create the database and insert the schema. On the second Specify Wizard window enter the Specify Master credentials, then click the <em>Test Master Login</em> button to verify the Specify Master credentials were created from within MySQL.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 1em;"></div>
<p>3. If you wish to create your own Specify database from within MySQL rather than using the Specify Wizard the Specify team provides both an explanation and script for performing this task from within MySQL on the Specify website at <a href="http://specifysoftware.org/content/creating-specify-database-within-mysql">http://specifysoftware.org/content/creating-specify-database-within-mysql</a>. </p>
<p><a name="mysql_username" id="mysql_username"></a></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../images/window1.png" /></p>
<p align="center"><span class="imgcaption">Enter MySQL IT Username and Password</span></p>
<p>This window allows you to either create a Specify database or verify that Specify can access a database you have already created within MySQL. To create or verify a database, you must first complete the following information:</p>
<p>The <strong>IT Username</strong> and <strong>IT Password</strong> must be an account with full administrator privileges in the MySQL database manager. This account will be used by the Specify Setup Wizard to create your Specify database and a Specify Administrative User account (in the next window) in MySQL. If you do not know the IT administrator (&quot;root&quot;) account username and password for MySQL, or do not have a MySQL installation, exit now. You can not go further without these.</p>
<p>The <strong>Database Name</strong> will be used to name the database that the Setup Wizard is about to create. If you do not have an existing database but are using the Wizard to create one, you are creating this name as you type it into the window. Once you name the database make sure to document it so you can reference if you need it at a later date.</p>
<p>If you have an existing database you much enter the name of the database in this text box so that the Wizard may verify that Specify can connect to the database before continuing with the Wizard.</p>
<p>The <strong>Host Name</strong> is the name of the computer that is running MySQL. This is either an IP Address  or a DNS (Domain Name Service) name. When running MySQL on your local machine this is almost always 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.</p>
<p>Note: When using an IP Address make sure that the IP is 'static'. </p>
<p><u><strong>Create a Specify Database</strong></u></p>
<p>When you click the <em>Create Specify Database</em> button Specify will connect to MySQL using the information you have entered and then create your Specify database and insert the Specify schema. If Specify can not connect to MySQL and build the database for any reason a message will display. To proceed in the Wizard you will need to verify that the information entered and MySQL setup are correct.</p>
<p><strong><u>Verify access to an existing Specify Database</u></strong></p>
<p>Enter your database information in this window, then click the <em>Test IT Login</em> button in the Advanced section of the window. The Wizard will verify that Specify can connect to your existing database. </p>
<p align="center"><a name="master_username" id="master_username"></a></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../images/window2.png"/></p>
<p align="center"><span class="imgcaption">Create a Master Username and Password</span></p>
<p>The security system for Specify 6 uses both a &quot;Master&quot; username and password, which Specify uses to access  the MySQL Database, as well as a User username and password, which allows people to run the Specify program. The Master account has SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE privileges on data tables in your Specify database only and has no other MySQL privileges. Specify uses only one Master username and password for all users, but encrypts the Master password with the User information, creating an encrypted string. This allows the Master information to become unique for each user. </p>
<p>This window either creates the Master Username and Password for your Specify system, or verifies that a Master username and password that has already been created within MySQL is recognized by Specify. Any instance of Specify that does not access MySQL on the local machine, (uses a remote server), must create the Master username and password using the MySQL Admin tool. This Master account must have SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE privileges on data tables in your Specify database.</p>
<p>When creating the Master username and password, the word &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;Root&quot; SHOULD NOT BE USED. Please create a unique Master username and  a secure, strong password for it. This should not be the same as the Username and Password used for the MySQL IT account in the previous window. This information should be remembered and secured by the person installing MySQL and Specify at your institution. The Specify administrator  (a role and  account within Specify) will need the Master username and password to create new user accounts in Specify. </p>
<p>Also, the &quot;Master&quot; username and password should not be used as a Specify user account name within Specify.  Whichever user name and password you choose for the Master account, that username and password is never used to log in to Specify. This &quot;Master&quot; username and password should ALWAYS be unique. Do not use this username and password for any other accounts in MySQL or Specify.</p>
<p><strong><u>Create the Master</u></strong></p>
<p>When you click the <em>Create Master User</em> button Specify will take a moment to create the Master account in the database. Once this account has been created you may not change the information on this screen, or  any previous screens; therefore, the <em>Back</em> button will become disabled.</p>
<p><u><strong>Test the Master</strong></u></p>
<p>Click the <em>Test Master Login</em> button to verify that Specify can connect to the Specify database using the existing master credentials that you have previously created in the MySQL command line tool. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../images/window_security.png"/></p>
<p align="center" class="imgcaption">Turn Security On/Off</p>
<p align="left">Specify Security refers to the set of permissions and entitlements within Specify which gives users the rights to see certain data and to use particular functions. If your Specify database will never have more than one user, then Security (i.e. permissions within Specify) can be turned off. This will give that user total access to all Specify program functions and data. Specify will not check the user type or the user's credentials within Specify to determine the level of database and component access that user will be given.</p>
<p align="left">If you will be creating multiple users within Specify it is recommended that you turn security on. </p>
<p align="left"><a name="create_it_user" id="create_it_user"></a></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../images/window3.png"/></p>
<p align="center"><span class="imgcaption">Create Specify Manager / Administrator</span></p>
<p>This account is the first Specify user account for your database, and is  created at the level of Manager, the highest  rank in the  Specify permission model. The account usually represents the primary user, or administrator, of your collection database and will also create an Administrator within Specify.    It is this username and password that will be used to log in to Specify for the first time, once this setup Wizard is finished. At that time additional users can be added within Specify. Protect the username and make the password strong. This Specify manager level information will  also be used to create a record in the Specify database for an &lsquo;Agent&rsquo; representing the same person. </p>
<p><a name="create_institution" id="create_institution"></a></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../images/window_inst.png"/></p>
<p align="center"><span class="imgcaption">Create Institution and Enter Information</span></p>
<p align="left">The Specify data management levels mimic  the common levels of hierarchy within institutions. Access to information and Specify tools are then set at the various levels both within the application and through the User Permissions. </p>
<p align="left">The Setup Wizard creates a single entry for each level of the hierarchy (Institution, Division, Discipline and Collection).  This is the first step in that process. Each of the screens for creating these levels must be completed before the <em>Next</em> button will become enabled.</p>
<p align="left">The <strong>Name</strong> should be the formal name for your institution. It is a field within the Specify database, is displayed on the Institution form, it can be queried and used in reports. </p>
<p align="left">The <strong>Code</strong> is typically an acronym, codon, abbreviation or short name for your institution (not your collection), if you don't know of one, put in a placeholder, this can be edited at at a later date. Institution codes are often required for web services such as DiGIR.</p>
<p align="left">The <strong>Institution Address</strong> information is also added to fields within the Specify database and displayed on the Institution form and can be queried and used in reports.</p>
<p align="left"><a name="choose_accession_level" id="choose_accession_level"></a></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../images/window4.png"/></p>
<p align="center" class="imgcaption">Choose Accession Level</p>
<p align="left">Accessioning is the formal process by which a specimen or object is legally accepted and recorded as a museum item and differs from cataloging.  Some museums and herbaria have a formal accessioning process, some do not. If your institution does not use the concept of accessions (typically handled by a registrar or administrative curator) then leave this item unchecked and simply click the <em>Next</em> button to proceed to the next window.</p>
<p align="left">For organizations that do recognize Accessions, the process usually entails documenting  proof of ownership (in the form of a signed deed of gift) and that the material was legally acquired (in the form of all associated permits - collecting, import and export). An accession usually covers an entire field trip and multiple catalog items could be included within a single accession.  For the institutions that use it, accessioning and its associated numbering system is usually set up as a standard museum-wide process, backed by policy.  </p>
<p align="left">The accession numbering scheme or sequence can either be recorded  at an Institution level for all collections (Globally) or at a Collection level. The way to do this within Specify is based on whether your institution has  staff which manage all Accession transactions for your institution, like a Registrar, or if Accessions and accession numbers will be managed and assigned  within one or more separate Divisions within the Institution.  Again, if you do not use Accessions, this choice can be ignored.  Assigning Accessions to be managed &quot;globally&quot; across the entire organization, will ensure that accession numbers and records are unique across all collections for the entire institution.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> If you choose to manage your Accessions globally you will be presented with the following window to choose a format. If you did not choose to manage your Accessions globally you will be presented with the window later in the Wizard process when you create a Collection.</p>

<p align="center" class="imgcaption">Create Accession Number Format</p>
<p align="left">Accession Numbers may require a format or may simply use a number. Choose None to leave the Accession Number as a text field on the Accession form. Accession Number formats are not editable once data has been entered in the database.</p>
<p align="left">Several formats are offered in the drop-down menu list:</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Accession Number</strong> (2009-AA-###) The year will appear automatically in the first section (2009) of the format, and can also be manually edited. The 'AA' section of the format is alphanumeric and accepts both characters <em>a</em> through <em>z</em> and numbers.  The ### section of the format is a number that is automatically incremented when Auto Numbering is turned on in Specify and manually entered when Auto Numbering is turned off. This format offers two alphanumeric characters and three incremented numbers. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>AccessionNumberByYear</strong> (2009-AA-AAA) The year will appear automatically in the first section (2009) of the format, and can also be manually edited. The 'A' sections of the format are alphanumeric and accept both characters <em>a</em> through <em>z</em> and numbers. This format offers two alphanumeric sections, the first is two characters in length and the second is three characters in length.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>AccessionStringFormatter</strong> (AAAAAA) This is a single alphanumeric format that accepts characters <em>a</em> through <em>z</em> and numbers. The Accession number would be seven characters in length.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Is Numeric</strong> will display a 'yes' if the format is numeric.</li>

<p align="left">Specify 6 visually presents some data  types in hierarchical tree displays. These data types include the Taxon, Geography, (Specimen) Storage, Chronostratigraphy and Lithostratigraphy tables. There are two distinctions for trees; the first is the tree definition, or list of all the Ranks (levels) included in each tree,  the second is the nodes which reside on the tree at each of these levels.  The ranks must first be defined, then nodes can be added. The Wizard offers a table  for each of the trees (Chronostratigraphy and Lithostratigraphy for paleo collections only) for creating  tree definitions. These can also be edited from within Specify.</p>

<p>Specify is able to accept data for  collection objects or observations without assigning a Catalog Number. But when Catalog Numbers are used, they must be unique for each lot, specimen or observation.  Many collections routinely assign catalog numbers to  incoming specimens, perhaps as part of the accessioning process. These numbers may require a format with specific sections for data such as Institution Code and year or they may simply use an incrementing number.</p>
<p>Catalog Numbers can either be unique to each Collection, shared by several or be used throughout the Institution. The Catalog Number chosen at this time will not affect where it is used relative to other Collections, this will be configured from within the Specify application. The Catalog Number format for this collection can not be edited once it is chosen.</p>
<p>Several formats are also available within this drop-down menu list:</p>
<p><strong>CatalogNumber</strong> (2009-######) The year will appear automatically in the first section (2009) of the format, and can also be manually edited.
