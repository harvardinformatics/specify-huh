<h2>Field Formatting Editor<br />
</h2>
<p align="left">If you have chosen to Create a new Catalog Number or Accession Number format from the Specify Setup Wizard you are now seeing the Field Formatting Editor.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../images/field_format1.png" alt="format" width="433" height="237" /></p>
<p align="center" class="imgcaption">Field Formatting Editor</p>
<p>A format  allows a field to include sections for different data, such as static text, a date or an incremented number. </p>
<p>The table, field and field length information is located on the top left.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Name</strong> is used within the application files. It should be text only and will not be displayed to the user anywhere else in the application.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Title</strong> will be displayed in any application format lists that are presented to the user. </li><br />
  <li><strong>Reset Counter Every Year</strong> will become enabled when a Numeric section that 'Is Incremented' is added to the format (this is explained in more detail in the following text). Checking this box will start a new count each year.</li>
  <br />
</ul>
<p>A format can be made up of one or many sections. Begin creating a format by clicking the <img src="../../images/add.png" alt="add" width="16" height="16" />(add) button on the right side of the editor to add a section. </p>
<p>Next, choose the type of section to add.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../images/field_format_2.png" alt="format" width="433" height="237" /></p>
<p align="center" class="imgcaption">Field Format Section Types</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Numeric</strong> may only be numbers and can be auto incremented by checking the 'Is Incrementer' box and using Auto Numbering when entering data. When auto numbering Specify will start incrementing from the highest number present for the section within the database. A numeric section can be set between 1 and 10 characters in length. To start a new count for each year check the <em>Restart counter every year</em> box.<br />
      <br />
    It is important to remember that   field formats are implemented at a Discipline level and that formats that include a section that is incremented will  include a numbering scheme that is shared by all Collections within the Discipline.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Alphanumeric</strong> may use both alphabetic characters <em>a</em> through <em>z</em> and numbers. A length field will appear which allows the section to be  set between 1 and 10 characters in length.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Alpha</strong> may only be alphabetic characters <em>a</em> through <em>z</em>. A length field will appear which allows the section to be  set between 1 and 10 characters in length.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Separator</strong> refers to a character that separates the various sections. Separator choices include - . / ' ' _ and are one character in length.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Year</strong> will automatically add the current year on a form, but can be edited. </li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Any char(acter)</strong> allows any alphabetic characters <em>a</em> through <em>z</em>, any number or any other keyboard character. A length field will appear which allows the section to be  set between 1 and 10 characters in length.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Constant</strong> refers to  any section that will remain constant and is not editable on a form. This type of section is useful when  an institution code is part of a format. Type the characters for the constant in the text field labeled <em>Text</em> located under the <em>Type</em> box. <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the section information is configured correctly add it to the format by clicking the <img src="../../images/green_up_arrow.png" alt="up arrow" width="16" height="16" /> button. </p>
<p>The section will appear in the window with the appropriate information in each of the columns.</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Type</strong> refers to the Type of section that was chosen from the pick list. </li><br />
  <li><strong>Value</strong> shows the character used to represent the segment in the Sample at the bottom of the window.</li><br />
  <li><strong>Size</strong> refers to the number of characters chosen for the section. This is not applicable to the Separator or Year section types.</li><br />
  <li><strong>Is By Year</strong> refers only the Year section type.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Is Incrementer</strong> refers only to the Numeric section type that is incremented. On the Wizard's Collection Number window it will display in the <strong><em>Is Numeric</em></strong> section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reorder sections by clicking the <img src="../../images/ReorderUp16x16.png" alt="reorder up" width="16" height="16" /> (reorder up) and <img src="../../images/ReorderDown16x16.png" alt="reorder down" width="16" height="16" /> (reorder down) buttons on the right side of the editor. </p>
<p>Delete unwanted sections by clicking the <img src="../../images/delete.png" alt="delete" width="16" height="16" /> (delete) button.</p>
<p>Continue adding sections until the format is complete and displays correctly in the <em>Sample</em> window at the bottom of the editor.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em>When manually entering a formatted number field, it is paramount that numbers be padded with 0's. For example, if 3 numbers are available in a numbering scheme (###) and the desired number is 1, then 001 must be entered. If only 1 is entered, then Specify will read this as 100. This will produce incorrect results in searches, queries and reports. </p>
<p>Once the format is complete click <a href="../Security/Wizard.html#collection_setup_wizard">HERE</a> to return to the Specify Setup Wizard help page. </p>
