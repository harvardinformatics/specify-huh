<h2>Subforms </h2>
<p>Forms are categorized for  the data that resides in each table (Collection Object, Taxon, Geography, etc.); however, much of the data within the tables is also linked, or related to each other. This prevents users from needing to retype the same information and assures that information is entered only one way (for example John Smith is not also entered as J. Smith or John Smyth). </p>
<p>Related information is added and edited in subforms within the main form. Data is added and edited in subforms the same way that it is added and edited to forms. Boxes are used in the same way and required fields have a bold label.</p>
<p>For more information about forms please refer to <a href="../Data_Entry/Using_Forms.html">Using Forms.</a></p>
