<h2>About Specify 6</h2>
<p>Specify is a database software application designed to support the efficient computerization and management of biological collections. Specify is distributed and licensed with no charge for non-profit collections by the Specify Software Project, based in the Biodiversity Institute at the University of Kansas, Lawrence. The Specify Software Project and its predecessor, the MUSE Project, have been supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation since 1987. The Specify Software Project web site is located at http://www.specifysoftware.org. Specify lets you easily store, organize, and retrieve information about the holdings of a collection, track any loans or exchanges of those holdings and share information within the community. Specify was designed to the specifications of the collection community data model; installations can be configured with multiple taxonomic collections as separate databases, or data can be managed together as a single, multi-disciplinary database. Specify’s design and functions support botany, entomology, herpetology, ichthyology, invertebrate zoology, mammalogy, ornithology, paleobotany, and vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology. </p>
<h3><strong><a name="using_help" id="using_help"></a>Specify Help</strong></h3>
<p>The Specify Help system can be opened from anywhere in the application by typing the<em> F1</em> key, or <em>function</em> + <em>F1</em> keys.   The Help system was designed to provide an overview of the modules within Specify as well as a guide for a given task. This is referred to as context sensitive help. When performing a given task in the application, type F1 and Specify Help will open to the corresponding documentation page. In the same sense, Help is best read while viewing and using the corresponding module in the application. A Table of Contents  is also provided. Specify Help was written in Java Help and includes  full-text search capabilities by clicking on the <IMG height=21 src="../../images/help_search_button.png" width=44 /> (search) button.</p>
