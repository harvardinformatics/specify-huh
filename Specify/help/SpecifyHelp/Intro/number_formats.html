<h2>Creating Field Formats</h2>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Accession and Catalog Number formats are configured during the institution setup but there may be other fields that require either a number scheme or a format. A format allows a field to include sections for different data, such as static text, a date or in incremented number. Gift Number and Loan Number often have a unique format within collections. These can be formatted in the Schema Configuration tool, which will change the format for the entire discipline. In other words, if a Gift Number  is formatted in the schema configuration all the collections within the discipline will be required to use the new format, which will display on the Gift form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create and choose a format for a field in the Field Formatting Editor, which is available in the Schema Configuration tool (<em>System &gt; Schema Configuration</em>). The Schema Configuration tool is only available to users in a Manager or Administrator group.</p>
<p>Once in the Schema Configuration tool, choose a table and field from the Table and Field lists (on the left side of the tool) respectively.</p>
<p>Field formatting functions are configured using the Format Type section at the bottom of the Schema Configuration tool.</p>
<p>Choose <em>Formatting</em> from the pick list next to the Format Type caption.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Creating a Field Format</h4>
<p>Click the <em>...</em> button to open the Field Formatting Editor.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/number_format_1.png" width="360" height="184" /></p>
<p>The table, field and field length information is located on the top left.</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong> is used within the application files. It should be text only and will not be displayed to the user anywhere else in the application.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong> will be displayed in any application format lists that are presented to the user. </p>
<p><strong>Reset Counter Every Year</strong> will become enabled when a Numeric section that 'Is Incrementer' is added to the format (this is explained in more detail in the following text). Checking this box will start a new count each year.</p>
<p>A format can be made up of one or many sections. Begin creating a format by clicking the <img src="../../images/add.png" width="16" height="16" />(add) button on the right side of the editor to add a section. </p>
<p>Next, choose the type of section to add.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/number_format_2.png" width="360" height="184" /></p>
<p><strong>Numeric</strong> may only be numbers and can be auto incremented by checking the 'Is Incrementer' box and using Auto Numbering when entering data. When auto numbering Specify will start incrementing from the highest number present for the section within the database. A numeric section can be set between 1 and 10 characters in length. To start a new count for each year check the <em>Restart counter every year</em> box.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that   field formats are implemented at a Discipline level and that formats that include a section that is incremented will  include a numbering scheme that is shared by all Collections within the Discipline. </p>
<p><strong>Alphanumeric</strong> may use both alphabetical characters <em>a</em> through <em>z</em> and numbers. A length field will appear which allows the section to be  set between 1 and 10 characters in length.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha</strong> may only be alphabetical characters <em>a</em> through <em>z</em>. A length field will appear which allows the section to be  set between 1 and 10 characters in length.</p>
<p><strong>Separator</strong> refers to a character that separates the various sections. Separator choices include - . / ' ' _ and are one character in length.</p>
<p><strong>Year</strong> will automatically add the current year on a form, but can be edited. </p>
<p><strong>Any char(acter)</strong> allows any alphabetical characters <em>a</em> through <em>z</em>, any number or any other keyboard character. A length field will appear which allows the section to be  set between 1 and 10 characters in length.</p>
<p><strong>Constant</strong> refers to  any section that will remain constant and is not editable on a form. This type of section is useful when  an institution code is part of a format. Type the characters for the constant in the text field labeled <em>Text</em> located under the <em>Type</em> box. The length of the Constant section limited to the number of characters remaining in the 50 character field length.</p>
<p>Once the section information is configured correctly add it to the format by clicking the <img src="../../images/green_up_arrow.png" width="16" height="16" /> button. </p>
<p>The section will appear in the window with the appropriate information in each of the columns.</p>
<p> <strong>Type</strong> refers to the Type of section that was chosen from the pick list. </p>
<p><strong>Value</strong> shows the character used to represent the segment in the Sample at the bottom of the window.</p>
<p><strong>Size</strong> refers to the number of characters chosen for the section. This is not applicable to the Separator or Year section types.</p>
<p><strong>Is By Year</strong> refers only the Year section type.</p>
<p><strong>Is Incrementer</strong> refers only to the Numeric section type that is incremented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reorder sections by clicking the <img src="../../images/ReorderUp16x16.png" width="16" height="16" /> (reorder up) and <img src="../../images/ReorderDown16x16.png" width="16" height="16" /> (reorder down) buttons on the right side of the editor. </p>
<p>Delete unwanted sections by clicking the <img src="../../images/delete.png" width="16" height="16" /> (delete) button.</p>
<p>Continue adding sections until the format is complete and displays correctly in the <em>Sample</em> window at the bottom of the editor.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em>When manually entering a formatted number field, it is paramount that numbers be padded with 0's. For example, if 3 numbers are available in a numbering scheme (###) and the desired number is 1, then 001 must be entered. If only 1 is entered, then Specify will read this as 100. This will produce incorrect results in searches, queries and reports. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Choose a Field Format</h4>
<p>Once a field format has been configured it will need to be selected from the center pick list on the main Schema Configuration window. </p>
