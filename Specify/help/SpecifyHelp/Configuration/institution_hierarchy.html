<h2><a name="institution_levels" id="institution_levels"></a>Adding Institutional Levels</h2>
<p> The Specify data management levels mimic  the common levels of hierarchy within institutions. Access to information and Specify tools are set at the various levels both within the application itself and through the User Permissions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Institution</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Division</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Discipline</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Collection</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Users</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  </ul>
<p>The   Divisions, Disciplines and Collections for each institution are added and edited in the System Configuration module of Specify;<em>Configuration at System &gt; System Setup &gt; Configuration</em>. All tabs need to be closed before opening the Configuration. This tool is available to Administrators only.</p>
<p>Collection information in Specify 6 databases is also organized at these institution levels to meet requirements for data integrity and data sharing among collections. Some data elements are commonly shared among all collections within an institution, while others are shared only among collections in the same taxonomic discipline, i.e. &quot;at the Discipline level&quot; in Specify. Before creating the institution levels it is imperative that an administrator also understand the data that is held at each level to create the correct setup.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../images/disciplines.png" width="827" height="233" /> </p>
<p>When using a database that was created using the Wizard any additional Division levels should be added first, then Discipline and then Collection. Each  is added at the level above it. For instance, Divisions are added within the Institution form. </p>

<h3><a name="edit_institution" id="edit_institution"></a>Edit Institution</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><a name="security_on" id="security_on"></a>Information for the Institution is edited in the Configuration tool;<em> System &gt; System Setup &gt; Configuration</em>. There may only be one Instituation for each instance of Specify. </p>
  <p>Open the Institution form by clicking <img src="../../images/institution_16.png" width="16" height="16" /> Institution on the side bar. </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> is the official name of the institution.</li><br />
    <li><strong>Security</strong> can be turned on or off for the entire Specify application on the Institution form by checking the box <em>Is Security On</em>. The status of security is shown on the status bar with an icon; <img src="../../images/security_on_20.png" alt="security" width="20" height="20" /> (security on), or <img src="../../images/security_off_20.png" alt="security" width="20" height="20" /> (security off). It is recommended that most instituations leave security on unless the application is being used by a single user. </li><br />
    <li><strong>Alt. Name</strong> is typically used when more than one code is used by an institution.</li><br />
    <li>The <strong>Code</strong> is typically an acronym, codon, abbreviation or short name for your institution (not your collection), if you don't know of one, put in a placeholder, this can be edited at a later date. Institution codes is a Darwin Core field used in DiGIR/TAPIR web services.</li><br />
    <li><strong>Min. Password Length</strong> allows a minimum password length to be enforced within Specify. The Specify default is eight (8) characters.</li><br />
    <li><strong>LSID</strong> <strong>Authority</strong> refers to the location of institution information for the unique LSID number given by Specify. This is typically the url for the instition.</li><br />
    <li><strong>IPR</strong></li><br />
    <li><strong>Copyright</strong>, <strong>Terms of Use</strong> and <strong>Disclaimer</strong> may be used for legal information regarding the use of the name of the institution. This information can be queried and included on reports.</li><br />
    <li><strong>Remarks</strong> can be used for any additional information required regarding the institution.</li><br />
  </ul>
  <p>Click on the <img src="../../images/address.png" alt="address" width="16" height="16" /> Address button to edit the address of the institution.</p>

<h4><strong><a name="add_division" id="add_division"></a>Add/Edit  Divisions</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>New divisions, disciplines and collections are added using the Configuration tool;<em>Configuration at System &gt; System Setup &gt; Configuration</em>.</p>
  <p>Divisions are added within a subform on the Institution form, and can be edited either from the institution subform or the division form. </p>
  <p>1. Click the <img src="../../images/institution_16.png" width="16" height="16" /> <em>Institution</em> button on the side bar of the Configuration tool to edit the institution or add a division.</p>
  <p>At least one division should appear in the division sub form. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Name</strong> is the only required field and is used in any lists of divisions within Specify as well as in the institution hierarchy.</p>
    <p><strong>Abbreviation</strong> refers to an existing abbreviation for the Division.</p>
    <p><strong>Alt Name</strong> provides another field for name. This is often useful when a particular Division has changed names or uses a longer name than is applicable to the Hierarchy list. </p>
    <p><strong>URI</strong> stands for Uniform Resource Identifier and refers to a  resource on the internet (a Division web site).</p>
    <p><strong>Icon URI</strong> This is a field for ABCD field. This is the path to an icon on the website that could be downloaded by another institution and displayed on their website to indicate a partnership.</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong> can be used to store further information about the Division.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>2. Click the <img src="../../images/add.png" width="16" height="16" /> (add) button to add a division. A Wizard will appear to help you setup your new division as well as one discipline and one collection within the division.</p>

    <p align="left">The <strong>Name</strong> will appear on the division form and  can be queried and used in reports. A division is used to collectively name similar collections e.g. the Division of Paleontology may include Vertebrate Paleontology, Invertebrate Paleontology and Paleobotany collection. The Name is a field within the Specify database and is displayed on the Institution form. It can be edited, queried and used in reports. </p>
    <p align="left">The <strong>Code</strong> can be a short name, acronym, codon or abbreviation. If your division does not have a code, put in a placeholder, (this is a required field), this can be edited at a later date. Division codes are sometimes required for web services.</p>

    <p>The  Wizard not only defines the taxon tree but also allows loading of an authority file for the discipline you are creating. <span class="style2">Authority files were created using data from the </span> Catalog of Life Project for some of the disciplines within Specify. If this window does not appear, there are no existing authority files for your chosen discipline. </p>
    <p>If  you choose to load the data into your tree the Taxon tree  will be populated with hundreds of taxon nodes and all associated data. Then, when adding Collection Objects into your database you can simply choose a taxa from the Taxon field rather than adding each individually as needed.</p>
    <p>Please note that loading the Taxon tree will also affect the tree definition. If you load the provided Taxon authority file for your discipline the accompanying tree definition may include Levels that were not defined by you in the previous window, but are necessary to include all the predefined Taxon information.</p>
    <p>Additional discipline-specific trees can be loaded from within Specify at the time new disciplines are created.</p>
    <p>Click the <em>Choose</em> button for a list of taxon files for the discipline you are creating. Not all disciplines offer more than one taxon file. Once the taxon file is chosen, information will display in the <strong>Source</strong>, <strong>Coverage</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> fields for that file. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Botany and Entomology authority files are partial due to the size of these files. Contact the Specify team at <strong>specify@ku.edu</strong> for additional authority files.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The<strong> Downloadable File</strong> section in this window allows you to choose taxon files from your hard drive. The Setup Wizard can only install files that were downloaded from the Specify website. The Specify team is currently in the process of creating more of these files.</p>

    <h4><u><a name="div_create_catalog_number" id="div_create_catalog_number"></a>Catalog Number Format</u></h4>
    <p>Specify is able to accept data for  collection objects or observations without assigning a Catalog Number. But when Catalog Numbers are used, they must be unique for each lot, specimen or observation.  Many collections routinely assign catalog numbers to  incoming specimens, perhaps as part of the accessioning process. These numbers may require a format with specific sections for data such as Institution Code and year or they may simply use an incrementing number.</p>
    <p>Catalog Numbers can either be unique to each Collection, shared by several collections or be used throughout the Institution. The Catalog Number chosen at this time will not affect where it is used relative to other collections, this will be configured from within the Specify application. The Catalog Number format for this collection can not be edited once it is chosen.</p>
    <p>Several formats are also available within this drop-down menu list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong align="left">Format</strong> offers several choices in the drop-down menu list:
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left"><strong>None</strong> is the default setting, which is a 60 character string field.</p>

          <p><strong>CatalogNumber</strong> (2009-######) The year will appear automatically in the first section (2009) of the format, and can also be manually edited inside Specify. The '###' section of the format is a number that is six digits in length. This section can be automatically incremented when Auto Numbering is turned on in Specify or manually entered when Auto Numbering is turned off. These two sections are separated by a dash.</p>
          <p><strong>CatalogNumberAlphaNumByYear</strong> (2009-######) The year will appear automatically in the first section (2009) of the format, and can also be manually edited from within Specify.

    <h4><u><a name="dis_preload_taxon" id="dis_preload_taxon"></a>Pre-Load Taxon Authority File</u></h4>
    <p>The  Wizard not only defines the taxon tree but also allows loading of an authority file for the discipline you are creating. <span class="style2">Authority files were created using data from the </span> Catalog of Life Project for some of the disciplines within Specify. If this window does not appear, there are no existing authority files for your chosen discipline. </p>
    <p>If  you choose to load the data into your tree the Taxon tree  will be populated with hundreds of taxon nodes and all associated data. Then, when adding Collection Objects into your database you can simply choose a taxa from the Taxon field rather than adding each individually as needed.</p>
    <p>Please note that loading the Taxon tree will also affect the tree definition. If you load the provided Taxon authority file for your discipline the accompanying tree definition may include Levels that were not defined by you in the previous window, but are necessary to include all the predefined Taxon information.</p>
    <p>Additional discipline-specific trees can be loaded from within Specify at the time new disciplines are created.</p>
    <p>Click the <em>Choose</em> button for a list of taxon files for the discipline you are creating. Not all disciplines offer more than one taxon file. Once the taxon file is chosen, information will display in the <strong>Source</strong>, <strong>Coverage</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> fields for that file. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Botany and Entomology authority files are partial due to the size of these files. Contact the Specify team at <strong>specify@ku.edu</strong> for additional authority files.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The<strong> Downloadable File</strong> section in this window allows you to choose taxon files from your hard drive. The Setup Wizard can only install files that were downloaded from the Specify website. The Specify team is currently in the process of creating more of these files.</p>

      <h4><u><a name="dis_create_catalog_number" id="dis_create_catalog_number"></a>Catalog Number Format</u></h4>
      <p>Specify is able to accept data for  collection objects or observations without assigning a Catalog Number. But when Catalog Numbers are used, they must be unique for each lot, specimen or observation.  Many collections routinely assign catalog numbers to  incoming specimens, perhaps as part of the accessioning process. These numbers may require a format with specific sections for data such as Institution Code and year or they may simply use an incrementing number.</p>
      <p>Catalog Numbers can either be unique to each Collection, shared by several collections or be used throughout the Institution. The Catalog Number chosen at this time will not affect where it is used relative to other collections, this will be configured from within the Specify application. The Catalog Number format for this collection can not be edited once it is chosen.</p>
      <p>Several formats are also available within this drop-down menu list:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong align="left">Format</strong> offers several choices in the drop-down menu list:
