          </h2>

    <p>
       Data forms are used for entering, editing and viewing collection data. Because Specify uses
      related fields to link information, most data can be entered using the Collection Object
      form, however it may be useful to enter background information, such as Agents and Collecting
      Events before entering Collection Objects.
    </p>
    <p>
       Access data forms by clicking the <img src="../../images/data_entry.png" width="20" height=
      "20">&nbsp;(Data ) button. A list of forms will appear in the side bar.
    </p>
    <p>
       Each discipline has access to a specific set of forms for viewing, entering and editing
      data. Specify ships with the most frequently used forms listed on the side bar. Less common
      forms are found by clicking <img height="32" alt="more forms" src=
      "../../images/more_forms.png" width="32">&nbsp;(More Forms) in the side bar and choosing a
      form from the pop-up dialog.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;    </p>
    <p>A <strong><a name="data_entry_configure"></a>Side Bar Data Form Configuration</strong> tool
      gives access to less frequently used forms and also allows the side bar and More Forms lists
      to be interchanged and rearranged:
  </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Right-button-click an open section of the side bar to activate the <img height="27" src=
      "../../images/configure_box.png" width="110">&nbsp;button or choose <em>Tabs &gt; Configure Side Bar</em> from the top menu bar.    </p>

        <li> Use the <img height="16" src="../../images/Map16x16.png" width="16">, and <img height="16"

          Extra Forms list and vise versa. </li>
        <li> Click the<img height="16" src="../../images/add.png" width="16">(add) button for a list of
          additional forms that can be moved into either the side bar or More Forms list. </li>
        <li> Click the <img height="16" src="../../images/delete.png" width="16">(delete) button to
          remove forms from either the side bar or More Forms list; this will put them back into the
          master list. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Deleting a form from the More Forms list also removes the represented table from any
        searches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deleting a form from either the side bar or Extra Forms will place it back in the master list
        which is accessed by the <img height="16" alt="add" src="../../images/add.png" width=
      "16">&nbsp;(add) button. </p>

  <h4>
       <a name="data_entry_trees"></a><u>Working with Forms and Trees
    </u></h4>
      <p>
        Specify represents Taxon, Geography, Storage, Lithostratigraphy and Chronostratigraphy data
        in both trees and forms. When entering data using a form, keep in mind that Carry Forward is
        not available for the Parent field and entering Child Nodes via the tree can save time and
        energy.      </p>
      <p>
        When adding, editing or viewing data as a tree, users can also access forms for individual
        nodes by clicking either the edit (<img height="16" alt="edit" src=
      "../../images/Edit-2-16x16.png" width="16">) button or the add (<img height="16" alt="add"
      src="../../images/add.png" width="16">) button. Trees are not accessible when using the form
        system.      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Tables can not be edited simultaneously in both the Tree and
          Form mode, or by multiple users. For example, if a user is editing the Taxon Tree and wants
          to open a Taxon Form, it will open as <em>View Only</em>. In addition, if another user tries
          to open either the Taxon Tree or Taxon Form, a dialog will pop-up stating that the Tree is
          locked and will open in <em>View Only</em> mode.        </p>

    <h4><u><a id="container" name="container"></a>Containers</u></h4>
    <p>New in Specify 6.3! Containers allow collection objects to be permanently 'grouped' together. Containers can be substrates or physical containment objects within a collection. For example, a microscope slide upon which one or more algal specimens (collection objects) are mounted can now be assigned a catalog number and be linked to the algal collection object records. Containers can hold specimens or other containers. A lichen specimen on the bark of a wood sample, might need to be cataloged as a collection object, with the piece of wood cataloged as a Container. A Container might also be a box of specimens (Collection Objects) that needs to be cataloged as a traceable collection artifact. A container must be linked to a collection object to be cataloged in a collection. For a more indepth explanation of the container concept in Specify please read the document, <em>Containers and Storage Concepts, </em>found on the <a href="http://specifysoftware.org/content/documentation">Documentation page</a> of the Specify website.</p>
    <p>Containers can be either physical or logical. The above examples are all physical containers. A logical container is one in which only associations are made. For example, a skin, jawbone and tail of an animal may exist in different storage units in a collection. Each of these is a separate collection object record in Specify but require a logical association. A named container can be created and each of the objects associated with the container.</p>
    <p>Containers should not be confused with nodes on a storage tree. Containers can be associated with a node on a storage tree but are not the actual node. The box in the example above would not be listed in the storage tree, but may  be stored on a shelf in a particular room. The shelf and room are part of the storage tree. </p>
    <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Containers and their associated collection objects must be within the same collection</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><u>Cataloged Containers</u></p>
      <p>Containers can be cataloged by first creating a collection object and then associating it with a container. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><u>Subcontainers </u></p>
      <p>A container that is contained in another container is called a subcontainer. Subcontainers may not  be cataloged.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Containers are created using a container form  or  a collection object form. The collection object form must be edited to include the container controls before containers can be created or associated through it. For more information about editing forms please contact Specify at <strong>specify@ku.edu</strong>.</p>

      <h4>
    <a name="collecting_event"></a><u>Collecting Event / Time and Place</u>    </h4>
      <p> One of the important curatorial decisions to be made early on is the use of �Collecting
        Events� in a collection. This is also named 'Time and Place' on some Data Type forms. A
        collecting event is described by the date and time of the collection together with collector
        names and a number associated either with all specimens collected at that date and time or a
        number associated with each individual specimen. </p>
      <p> In the first case (traditionally used in lot based collections) the number is associated
        with the Collecting Event itself (and all its associated data) in the form of a Station or
        Field Number and is therefore associated with one or many specimens or collection objects collected
        at the same time and place by the same collectors e.g. ACB 09-01. The Station or Field number
        thus describes all specimens or Collection Objects collected at that time and place. There is
        a many-to-one relationship between specimens, or Collection Object and "Collecting Events".
        In this instance, the Collecting Event form is usually expressed as a Query Combo Box on the
        Collection Object form so that values can be searched, and the same
        collecting event can be used (based on the Station/Field Number) for entering information for
        multiple specimens without having to enter it repeatedly. The data displayed
        within the Query Combo Box is then formatted using the Schema Localizer to display a textual
        string representing the different data elements of the Collecting Event (Field Number, Date,
        Geography and Locality information). The lookup function of the Query Combo Box will also
        display this format to aid in selecting the correct Collecting Event for subsequent
        specimens. </p>
      <p> In the alternate case (used by all other disciplines) the number is associated with each
        individual specimen or Collection Object in the form of a Collector number - a unique number
        given to every specimen collected and usually including the Collectors acronym e.g. ACB
        12345, while the remaining data is still bound to the Collecting Event table. There is a
        one-to-one relationship between specimens and Collecting Events. In this instance the
        Collector number would be a field on the Collection Object form and all other fields would be
        associated with the Collecting Event which would not include a Station/Field Number and would
        be expressed as an embedded sub form on the Collection Object form and would not be able to
        be reused for subsequent specimens. </p>
      <p>
        Disciplines traditionally use one of these two methods.      </p>
      <p>
        A method should be chosen before data is entered, uploaded, or migrated into your
        database by our staff. To facilitate our set up of forms for evaluation, we have set
        defaults for collection types and Specify ships with all Disciplines except Ichthyology using
        Collection Event as a one-to-one relationship. If the default form does not represent the way
        you process collections, and you are unable to change the setting after following the
        instructions, you should contact us for setup instructions, rather than altering your
        workflow or introducing a new process or number.      </p>
      <p>
        If forms are changed from a one-to-one relationship to a one-to-many relationship the
        checkbox for 'Add Collecting Even Automatically' on the Collection form (<em>System &gt;
        System Setup &gt; Configuration</em>) will need to be unchecked after importing the new form.      </p>

        <td width="77%">

        <td>
          This is an individual with field options of first, middle and last name, abbreviation,
          email and multiple addresses and attachments.        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          
        <div align="left"><strong>Organization</strong>          </div></td>
        <td>

        <td>
          
        <div align="left"><strong>Group</strong>          </div></td>
        <td>
          Using a group option allows multiple agents to be associated with one name entity. This
          type of Agent includes name, abbreviation, email and links to individual Agents that are
          a part of the group. This option is useful when it is necessary to search by the group
          name.        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          
        <div align="left"><strong>Other</strong>          </div></td>
        <td>
          Other is used when the other three options do not apply. Name and attachments are the
          only fields for this agent type.        </td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p>
        It is also important to note that Agents are shared throughout a Division. In other words,
        if a division has two disciplines (A and B) and division A creates an Agent, division B, as well as all collections within the two divisions, 
        will also have access to that agent.    </p>
