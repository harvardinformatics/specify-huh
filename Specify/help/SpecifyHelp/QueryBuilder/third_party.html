    </h2>
    <p>
       Sharing Specify data with third parties, such as Darwin Core or OBIS, is a two-step process.
      First, the schema of the third party must be mapped to the Specify schema using the Schema
      Mapping Editor inside Specify. Next, the data file is created and/or updated using the Data
      Exporter stand-alone application (found in the bin directory within the Specify application
      directory).

    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p> Specify 6.1 takes advantage of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility's (GBIF)
        Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) to publish Specify data to the web. IPT is an
        open-source, Java web application designed to publish biodiversity data on the Internet. The
        IPT creates an HTML web site on your web server and starts a network service that publishes
        your collection's data with the TAPIR data communications protocol. GBIF can then be notified
        of the existence of your IPT server to make first contact and integrate your data into the
        GBIF cache. &nbsp;You will be assimilated. Specify no longer uses its own web interface
        software nor the DiGIR protocol for serving XML encoded data. See <a href=
      "http://ipt.gbif.org">http://ipt.gbif.org</a> for additional information regarding IPT.
      </p>
      <p> Using the Integrated Publishing Toolkit to display and publish, Specify collection data
        requires several steps. First, Tomcat must be installed on the computer that will be serving
        data to the Internet. &nbsp;Next, the Specify data must be mapped to schema authority, such
        as Darwin Core, from inside Specify. A separate Specify tool, Data Exporter, is then used to
        create (build) the data file for IPT. Last, IPT must be setup to display Specify data. Each
        of these steps is explained in the pdf document, <em>Publishing Specify Data with IPT,</em>
        found on the Specify website documentation page at <a href=
      "http://specifysoftware.org/content/documentation">http://specifysoftware.org/content/documentation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This help document will explain how to define, or 'map', the Specify fields to those found
        in an IPT. Documentation for building the data file from within the Data Exporter tool is
        available online when using the tool.

            Right-button-Click in the side bar, then choose <em>Delete Schema</em> in the resulting
            context menu. You may also delete the file directly from your Specify/Config directory.          </p>
          <p> The next step in the process is to map the relevant fields in your database to the fields in

              displayed as a 'place-holder' in the lower section of the screen. The left-most column in
              the display is the name of the term. After a term is mapped, the remaining columns are
              similar to those in the regular query builder, except that some options, (such as
              'Display') are not available. Specify will automatically map fields to recognized concepts.
              (Auto-mapping is currently optimized for Darwin Core terms) Other terms unmapped by
              Specify's auto-mapping will need to be manually mapped. &nbsp;Criteria can also be added to
              the mapping to restrict or remove certain records from the build and to eliminate
              duplication of records due to the one-to-many relationships within Specify. </li>

        <p> IPT and Specify require that all uploaded records be unique.&nbsp; Due to the one-to-many
          relationships contained in Specify databases it may be necessary to add certain conditional
          fields to the schema to ensure this e.g. adding the Determination Current field and setting
          it to <em>Yes</em> will eliminate multiple determinations.&nbsp; One can also select a table
          to take advantage of the formatted and aggregated value for that table e.g. selecting the
          Collectors table will add all collectors on a single line.&nbsp; Fields can also be added to
          eliminate certain records from the resulting cache </p>
