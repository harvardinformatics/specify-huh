<p><a name="query_overview" id="query_overview"></a>One of the benefits and goals of  entering data into the Specify database is to be able to retrieve the data in an organized manner. Specify's Query builder offers a flexible interface for defining and running searches. Queries are a precise request for information retrieval and can restrict the type of returned records based on the contents of almost any of Specify's  data fields. </p>
<p>These queries can then be used to create <a href="../RecordSet/record_set.html">Record Sets</a> or <a href="../ReportsLabels/reports.html">Reports</a>. </p>
<p>Open the query builder by clicking the <img src="../../images/query20x20.png" width="20" height="20" /> (Query button) on the Taskbar.</p>
<p>The Sidebar displays a list of frequently used tables to begin the query configuration. Less common tables are found by clicking <img src="../../images/more_tables.png" width="20" height="20" /> (More Tables)  in the sidebar and choosing a table from the pop-up dialog. </p>
<p>A <strong><a name="query_creators"></a>Query Creators  Configuration</strong> tool gives access to less frequently used tables and also allows the Sidebar and More Tables lists to be interchanged and rearranged:</p>
<p>Choose <em>Tabs &gt; Configure Sidebar</em> from the Menu bar or right-button-click an open section of the sidebar to activate the Context Menu and choose <em>Configure</em><em> Query Creators</em> to open the Configure New Queries dialog.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the <img src="../../images/ReorderUp16x16.png" alt="b" width="16" height="16" /> or <img src="../../images/ReorderDown16x16.png" alt="b" width="16" height="16" /> (reorder) button to change the order in which the forms appear in the Sidebar and More Forms list.</li>
  <li>Use the <img src="../../images/Map16x16.png" alt="b" width="16" height="16" /> or <img src="../../images/Unmap16x16.png" alt="b" width="16" height="16" /> (move) button to move a Sidebar item to the Extra Forms list and vise versa. </li>
  <li>Click the <img src="../../images/add.png" alt="b" width="16" height="16" /> (add) button for a list of additional forms that can be moved into either the Sidebar or More Forms list.</li>
  <li>Click the <img src="../../images/delete.png" alt="b" width="16" height="16" /> (delete) button to remove forms from either the Sidebar or More Forms list; this will put them back into the master list.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> deleting a table from either the Sidebar or More Tables will place it back in the master list which is accessed by the <img src="../../images/add.png" alt="add" width="16" height="16" /> (add) button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a name="configure_queries" id="configure_queries"></a><strong>Configure Saved Queries</strong> tool allows saved queries to be rearranged on  the Sidebar. Choose <em>Tabs &gt; Configure Sidebar</em> from the Menu bar or right-button-click an open section of the sidebar to activate the Context Menu.</p>
<p>Choose <em>Configure</em><em> Queries</em> to open the Configure Queries dialog.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the <img src="../../images/ReorderUp16x16.png" alt="b" width="16" height="16" /> or <img src="../../images/ReorderDown16x16.png" alt="b" width="16" height="16" /> (reorder) buttons to change the order in which the forms appear in the Sidebar and More Forms list.</li>
  <li>Use the <img src="../../images/Map16x16.png" alt="b" width="16" height="16" /> or <img src="../../images/Unmap16x16.png" alt="b" width="16" height="16" /> (move) buttons to move a saved query from the Favorite Queries sidebar list to the Other Queries list and vice versa. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choose a table from the Sidebar list to begin building the query. </p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Because of the way Specify combines related information, almost every field can be found from within most tables. This will determine the data elements to be returned i.e. searching from Collection Objects (CO) will return CO records. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="q_fields" id="q_tables"></a>Choose Fields</h4>
<p>A list of fields available in the chosen table, as well as other related  tables, appears in a list box at the top of the query work space. </p>
<p>To display fields in other tables, simply click  a table in the list box. Fields and other related tables  display in a new list box.</p>
<p>Choose fields and/or tables for the query from within the appropriate list boxes by either selecting the field/table and clicking the <img src="../../images/add.png" alt="add" width="16" height="16" /> (add) button or double clicking on the table/field.</p>
<p>By selecting fields to include in the search users can restrict the type of returned records based on the contents of almost any of Specify's 2500 data fields.</p>
<p>There is no limit on the number of fields added to a query, but larger, more complex queries will take a longer amount of time to run. </p>
<p>Specify 6 does not include default fields in a query as was found in Specify 5. For a column to appear in the results it must first be represented by a field in the query. Users that wish to always see a particular set of columns in their query results are encouraged to create a query with those fields and save the query. When creating a future query simply click on the saved query first, then add to it to create the new query.</p>
<p>Specify 6 offers a grid view of results only. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><a name="q_tables" id="query_add_tables"></a>Choose Tables </strong></h4>
<p>Select a related table to be part of the search criteria by double clicking it in the list box.  Tables are either formatted or aggregated, depending on their relationship to the primary Table, and do not offer any other search criteria. Most tables in Specify have a default format and aggregate setting. Formats and aggregates can be edited, created or deleted  in <em>System &gt; Schema Configuration</em>.</p>
<p><strong><img src="../../images/SingleKid.png" alt="many-to-one" width="16" height="16" /> Many-to-One</strong> (Formatted Data)</p>
<p>A relationship involving a primary and related table in which many primary records are linked to a single related record in the related table. For example, many Collection Object records might be linked to the same Locality record because they were all found at the same location.</p>
<p>Tables with a many-to-one relationship are designated by an (<strong><img src="../../images/SingleKid.png" width="16" height="16" />). </strong>Tables with many-to-one relationships are formatted to be represented by at least one field. Most tables are represented by only one field, (Collection Object shows the Catalog Number), but some are best represented by more than one field (Agent may be formatted to display last name, first name, middle initial). Query results use this format when returning results. </p>
<p><strong><img src="../../images/MultiKid.png" alt="one-to-many" width="16" height="16" /> One-to-Many</strong> (Aggregated Data)</p>
<p>A relationship involving a primary and related table in which many related records are linked to a single primary record in the related table. For example, several Collection Object records would be linked to a single record in the Collection Event table because all those specimens were collected during the same event.</p>
<p>Tables with a one-to-many relationship  are designated by an icon (<strong><img src="../../images/MultiKid.png" width="16" height="16" />)</strong> and return aggregated data. For example, a Collection Object can have many Preparations. The results of a query of Collection Objects with Preparations will return Preparations aggregated together in one column, separated by colons or semi colons. </p>
<p>When returning aggregated data, it is possible that a field may first be formatted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="q_express" id="q_express"></a>Query Expressions</strong></p>
<p>Create Query Expressions to narrow the results. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/query_criteria.png" width="1187" height="48" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Not all fields include Criteria. For instance; a Check Box does not have searchable Criteria and needs only an Operator.</p>
