    <p>
       The Data Exporter application is used to build, update and export data files for use by IPT.
      The term 'build' refers to the process Specify uses to load data into the skeleton, or schema, of a database. Before a data file can be built, a 'schema map' must first be creatd using the Schema Mapping Editor inside Specify. If you have not created a schema map you will need to close the Data Exporter tool, reopen Specify and create the schema map using the Schema Mapper tool.  For documentation explaining how to create a schema map please refer
      to <a href="../QueryBuilder/third_party.html">Web Publishing</a>.    </p>
<p>
       The Data Exporter tool actually creates a table, or cache, in the database containing all
      relevant data based on the map that was created from inside Specify.&nbsp; This table of data
      then needs to be exported as a tab delimited text file for importing into IPT.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       The Data Exporter application is located in the bin directory within the Specify application
      directory, which stores the executable files for Specify. Double click Data<em>Exporter</em>
      (or select it from Start/Program Files/Specify on Windows) to launch the tool. Users are
      required to login using their Specify Username and Password.
    </p>
    <p>
       The Data Exporter application opens as a three column table with action buttons.

<ul type="disc">
      <li>
        The <strong>Mapping</strong> column of the table indicates the name of both the mapping and table.      </li>
<li>
        The <strong>Last Update</strong> column lists the date and time of the last update of the cache.      </li>
<li>
        The <strong>Status</strong> column indicates whether the cache is out of date, and, if so, how many rows
        are out of date. The number of out of date rows includes the number of rows that have been
        deleted from the database together with the number of rows that need to be updated due to
        changes in the database and the number of new rows in the database which must be added to
        the cache. This information reflects the database contents at the time the exporter was
        launched; it will not reflect changes to the database that occur while the exporter is
        running.      </li>

    <h3>
       <strong>Available Actions</strong>    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>

        <strong>Show SQL</strong> - Click this button for a mapping whose cache has been completed
        to generate a dialog showing an SQL select statement that can be copied and used when
        defining database connections to the cache for IPT or other data providers.
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            
            <em><strong>Note</strong></em>: the SQL is based on the current cache structure. If the
            cache needs to be rebuilt and mappings have been changed, the SQL statement generated will
            not reflect the changes until the cache is updated.      </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>         </em> <strong>Update/Build</strong> - This will update the cache.&nbsp;When the cache is
        built or updated it is writing to the database; therefore, the username and password for the
        database is required before Specify can complete the task. </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        For caches that do not need to be built, only out-of-date rows are updated. This is
        significantly faster than an initial build which can take a long time.&nbsp; Updates are not
        allowed for mappings that are being edited or updated by another user; therefore, users
        should close all schema mappings before updating. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
         
        <strong>Export</strong> - This exports the current contents of the cache to a tab-delimited
        text file.
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><em>
            <strong>Note</strong>:</em> The CURRENT contents are exported, if the cache needs to be
              updated, you should update first if you want to export the latest data.<br>
              </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
<p>
       <em>Cancelling an Operation</em> - You can cancel an update or export by clicking the <img
      src="../../images/close_hover.png">&nbsp;(close) button to close the application window. You
      will be asked to confirm the cancellation. If you cancel, you will need to start from the
      beginning the next time you perform the operation.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong><span class="style1">Note</span></strong><span class="style1">:</span>&nbsp; If you
        cancel an update that required a rebuild, the pre-existing cache will have been deleted. </p>
