<h2><img src="../../images/Tree_big.png" width="32" height="32"> Trees in Specify</h2>

    <p>
       Specify 6 visually presents some data types in hierarchical tree displays. These data types
      include the Taxon, Geography, (Specimen) Storage, Chronostratigraphy and Lithostratigraphy
      tables. These data types, or tables, are also included in the form system, but the tree
      offers a more broader visual glimpse of the data. Data can be viewed, added and edited using
      both the form and tree system.
    </p>
    <p>
       The Taxon, Geography, Chronostratigraphy and Lithostratigraphy trees (and tables) are scoped
      at the Discipline level, meaning that all collections within a discipline share the same
      tree. Collection Objects that are associated with the nodes on the tree are only available
      for the collection (these are accessed from the tree by right-clicking the node and choosing
      <em>Associated Collection Objects</em> from the ensuing context menu.)
    </p>
    <p>
       The Storage tree is scoped at the institution level, but as with the other trees only
      collection objects for the current collection will be shown when right-clicking on the node
      and choosing Associated Collection Objects from the context menu.
    </p>
    <p>
       The default permissions that Specify ships with allow Guest users to View the trees, but not
      modify them in any way. All other users can use trees in their entirety.

    <h3>
       <a name="trees_terms" id="trees_terms"></a>Specify Tree Terminology    </h3>
<blockquote>
      <p>
        The various Trees show relationships in a hierarchical structure. All hierarchies are
        referred to as <strong>ranks</strong>. All nodes immediately under a rank are referred to as
        <strong>children</strong>. Any node with a child is referred to as a <strong>parent</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ranks are shown in columns on the tree. tree column colors can be set in <em>Preferences
        &gt; Tree</em>. See also <a href="../Prefs/Tree.html"><em>Preferences</em></a>.
      </p>

    <h3>
       <strong><a name="trees_build" id="trees_build"></a>Building Ranks</strong>    </h3>
<blockquote>
      <p>
        Each tree is visualy displayed as heirarchical levels. The Levels must first be defined in a tree definition, then nodes can be added. Levels are
        defined through the use of either the Specify Setup Wizard and the Add a Discipline
        Wizard. Levels are edited, enforced in the <a href="../Trees/editing_tree_def.html">Tree
        Definition</a> tool. The full name is also configured in the tree definition tool. </p>

    <h3>
       <strong><a name="trees_build" id="trees_build"></a>Building Trees</strong>    </h3>
<blockquote>
      <p>
        All Trees can be defined and loaded into Specify through either the Specify Setup Wizard or
        the Add a Discipline Wizard. Data in these trees include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Converted Taxon authority files for each of the Disciplines from the Catalog of Life. </li>
        <li> Converted Geographic authority files from <span class="style2">online website of the World
          Gazetteer</span>, which includes Continent, Country, and States throughout the world as
          well as County data for the United States. </li>
        <li> Chronostratigraphy authority files for five ranks in the North American System as converted
          from the Geological Society of America. </li>
        <li> Four predefined ranks for Lithostratigraphy. </li>
        <li> Ranks for the Storage tree. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Users who do not wish to build their trees through a Specify Wizard may build their own
        trees in the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Manually by adding one record at a time. This will be necessary for the Storage tree, as it
          is unique to each Institution and Collection.        </li>
<br />
        <li>
          Dynamically from an existing user database. This may include a conversion from Specify 5 or
          other type of database, which the Specify team can help with, or a data import through the
          WorkBench.    <br>
  </li>
  
  <li>
        Dynamically by downloading and importing an authority file from an authority source.    </li>
  </ul>

       <a name="trees_using" id="trees_using"></a>Using Trees    </h3>
<blockquote>
      <p>
        Trees are available through a tree button on the task bar. The task bar is configurable in
        Preferences. Users that do not have the tree button included on their task bar can add it by
        clicking <em><span class="michaelschanges">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Task
          Bar</span></em><span class="michaelschanges"> on Windows, or <em>Specify &gt; Preferences
          &gt; Task Bar</em> on the Mac, then checking the <em>Trees</em> box.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Tree and Task Bar preferences are only available to users with permission to use the trees. </p>
<p>
        Click <em><img height="20" src="../../images/Tree-32x32.png" width="20">&nbsp;Trees</em> on
        the task bar to open the tree tool. Trees are grouped by their task on the side bar.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>Edit Trees</strong> lists the Trees available for the collection. Click a tree to
          open it in the work space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Edit Tree Definitions</strong> lists the Definitions for each tree. This tool
          defines the ranks available in a tree as well as with how these ranks are enforced in data
          entry and used in aggregating the full name. Before adding nodes to an empty tree, the tree
          Definition must be completed. Please refer to <a href="../Trees/editing_tree_def.html">Tree
            Definitions.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Unlock a Tree</strong> is only available to users with appropriate permission.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Simultaneous editing of a tree or tree definition  and the corresponding form is also not permitted by a
        single user. Multiple users can edit tree data in a form but a tree, or tree definition, and corresponding form may not be open at the same time.   Trees are available for viewing, searching or querying simultaneously, but not editing. A second user may only edit a tree or tree definition after the first user closes their tree.      </p>
      <p>
      If your project requires multiple users to add data to a Geography, Taxon, Storage, Lithostratigraphy or Chronostratigraphy table, they will need to use the related form. </p>
      <p>When a tree is being edited by a user (A) and another user (B) opens the tree, a prompt will
        notify user (B) that the tree is in use by user (A) and will open in View mode. Then the tree
      will open to view. </p>
      <p>
        When a tree Definition is open and the same user opens the corresponding tree, the tree
        Definition does not need to be closed, the tree will display in the tree tab. The Definition
        is not available to View and those without editing privileges may not access it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event that a tree becomes locked and the user of that tree can not be located, (which
        may occur due to improper shutdowns of the application, or someone leaving their desk without closing a tree), the tree can be unlocked, by clicking
        it under the 'Unlock a Tree' heading if you have the necessary permissions. This action will remove the original user from the tree.</p>

    <a name="drag_drop" id="drag_drop">Dragging and Dropping</a> to Move, Synonymize or Merge nodes in a Tree</h3>
     <blockquote>
       <p>
         Nodes can be dragged and dropped onto other nodes within a tree. When the screen is split, nodes can be
         dragged and dropped within the same screen or into the opposite screen. While dragging a node a highlight box will
         appear around any nodes that can accept the node being dragged (the hightlight will appear when the node being dragged is over the top of the accepting node). Dragging and dropping is used
         to:       </p>
       <p>
         <strong><a name="move_node"><u>Move</u></a></strong> a node (and its child nodes) to a new parent.
         This is useful when a data entry error has occurred, or a new node has been introduced while
         uploading from the WorkBench. Nodes may be moved between ranks, but enforced ranks may not be
         skipped.
       Moves may only occur when a node <strong>Does Not</strong> have any children.</p>
       <p>
         <strong><a name="synonymize_node"><u>Synonymize</u></a></strong> the node (in the Geography and
         Taxon trees only). The node that is dragged and dropped becomes a synonym of the accepting,
         or target node. The target node is then the Preferred node. Changes in taxon are reelected in
         fields in the Determinations table. Collection object determinations are captured in the
         Taxon and Preferred Taxon fields. When a taxon is not a synonymy these fields will both refer
         to the same taxon (A). If taxon (A) becomes a synonymy of taxon (B) the Taxon field will
         still reflect Taxon (A) but the Preferred Taxon will change to Taxon (B).       </p>
       <p>
         Child nodes can not be added to a synonymized node and, in the same instance, parent nodes
         can not be synonymized unless their child nodes are first synonymized.       </p>
       <p>
         In the Taxon tree, nodes at the species level and below can be synonymized within and
         between ranks, but any node higher than species can only be synonymized within the same rank.
         In other words, a family level node may only be synonymized to another family level node.       </p>
       <p>
         Synonyms are differentiated from non-synonyms by their text color. Synonym text color can be
         set in <a href="../Prefs/Tree.html"><em>Preferences</em></a>. Synonyms also show as a tool
         tip on the node. Tool tips are displayed by holding the mouse over a rank.       </p>
       <p>
         To undo a synonymy, right-click on the node, then click <em>Undo Synonymy</em> in the
         resulting Context Menu.       </p>
       <blockquote>
         <p>
           <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> When taxa are synonymized  in the Taxon tree,
           the Preferred Taxon field on the determination form is updated.       </p>
           </blockquote>
       <p><strong><a name="merge_node" id="merge_node"><u>Merge</u></a></strong> parts of the tree. This is typically performed to correct parts of the tree that are duplicated. For instance; if the country of the United States of America were entered as both United States and US and both included a large number of children, a correction would require many moves. In version 6.3 and newer a Tree Merge function has been added to allow users to combine all the child information and choose the accepted form of a parent. The children of the node being dragged (unwanted node) will merge with those included in the node being targeted (remaining node) and the unwanted node will dissappear. For example, if in the example above the United States included the states of Kansas and South Dakota and the US included the states of California and Hawaii and the user dragged the US node and droppped it onto the United States node the tree will have only the United States as a country (parent) with the states (children) California, Hawaii, Kansas and South Dakota. If both nodes contain Kansas with various counties these will be combined into a single node and all counties accumulated or merged as required.</p>
       <p>Once the node is dropped onto the accepting node a dialog will appear asking if the user
         would like to perform the appropriate task; i.e. <strong>synonymize</strong> the node (when applicable), <strong>move</strong> the node (when applicable) or <strong>merge</strong> the node and children (when applicable). </p>
       <p>
         Select <strong>Cancel</strong> on the dialog to place the node back in its original
         position.       </p>

    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Counts of collection objects associated with each node can be enabled for all trees. This
        feature requires data processing and therefore is not enabled by default. Enable Collection
        Object Counts on a tree by choosing <em>Preferences &gt; Tree</em>. See also <a href=
      "../Prefs/Tree.html"><em>Preferences</em></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Counts are displayed next to the Node as two numbers
        (<strong>X</strong>,<strong>Y</strong>):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>X</strong> represents the number of Collection Objects for the Node only.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Y</strong> represents the number of Collection Objects for the Rank and all nodes
          beneath it. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The last node on the tree will only show the X value, as there are no nodes beneath it.      </p>
