       The Tree Definition tool defines the levels, or ranks available in a tree as well as how these ranks
      are enforced during data entry, and used in aggregating the full name. Tree Definition tools are
      available for each of the trees. Nodes can not be added to a tree unless the rank isincluded in
      the tree definition.
    </p>
    <p>
       The Tree Definition is configured during both the Specify Setup Wizard and the Discipline
      Wizard that is run when a Discipline is added. The Tree Definition can be edited from within
      Specify as well.
    </p>
    <p>
       Click the <em><img width="20" height="20" alt="tree" src=
      "../../images/Tree-32x32.png">&nbsp;Trees</em> button on the task bar, then select a tree from
      the side bar list under <em>Open Tree Definition</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
       The resulting window displays a hierarchical list of included Ranks in a grid view.
    </p>
    <p>
       A tree and corresponding form may not be open at the same time. If either a tree or form is
      open, the other will only be available in view mode. For example, if user A is editing the
      Taxon tree,  user B will not be allowed to edit a Taxon form.    </p>
<p>
       Also, a tree and tree definition representing the same table can not be open at the same
      time. If the tree definition is open and the tree is selected the tree will replace the
      tree definition in the same tab, therefore closing the tree definition. The tree definition is not
      available to View and those without editing privileges may not access it.    </p>

        Click on the <img width="16" height="16" alt="edit" src=

        of the tree. This is also the name that will be given to the first node in the tree. </p>

      <p>
        Buttons for editing (<img width="16" height="16" alt="edit" src=
      "../../images/Edit-2-16x16.png">), and adding (<img width="16" height="16" alt="" src=
      "../../images/add.png">), deleting (<img width="16" height="16" alt="delete" src=
      "../../images/delete.png">) ranks are located at the bottom right of the Workspace window.
      </p>
      <p>
        Select a rank, then either double click to edit the rank or select  <strong>edit</strong> or <strong>add</strong> to open the
        Rank Properties dialog. New ranks will be added below the selected rank; therefore, select the parent of the rank you wish to add.  </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name</strong> refers to the name of the rank used internally by Specify but not visible to the user.        </li><br />

        <li><strong>Title</strong> is the name of the rank displayed to the user in the tree, queries and reports. </li><br />
  
        <li><strong>Remarks</strong> allows remarks to be entered regarding the rank.      </li><br />
    
        <li><strong>In Full Name</strong> will use the rank when displaying the full name for any
          associated Collection Objects (which appears in the Taxon Full Name field of the taxon
          table). The Full Name is also displayed in the Preferred Taxon field on the Determinations
          form and is useful when running queries and reports when the full name is desired.<br>
        </li>
        <br />
    
        <li><strong>Enforced</strong> ensures that the Rank can not be skipped when attaching children.       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Click the delete button to delete a rank. Ranks may <strong>NOT</strong> be deleted if nodes
        are associated with them. It is important to remember that the Institution tree is shared by
        all collections in an institution and all other trees are shared by all collections within a
        single Discipline. Ranks that are not being used by your collection may have associated nodes
        in other collections and therefore can not be deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the change is saved the tree will update. If the tree is extremely large, this may take
        several minutes.    </p>

    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Any time a tree is edited it is also updated within the database. If this process is interrupted, the tree will need to update when Specify
        re-launches. A prompt will appear notifying the user that the tree is updating. A manual
        update can also be performed by clicking <em>System &gt; Trees &gt; Update</em> (tree type) <em>Tree</em>.    </p>

    <h3>
       <a id="tree_pre" name="trees_pre"></a>Predefined Ranks
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Taxon, Chronostratigraphy, Geography and Lithostratigraphy include predefined ranks for the
        tree definitions. The Geography, Chronostratigraphy and Lithostratigraphy predefined ranks
        are also active within the tree definition. The Taxon tree includes many ranks that are not
        active and are offered via a Predefined Ranks dialog when adding a Rank. If the list does not
        include the desired Rank, one can be added by clicking the <em>Custom</em> button and naming
        the rank in the ensuing <em>Edit Rank Properties</em> dialog.
      </p>
      <p>
        If predefined ranks are deleted from the tree definition, they will be added back into the
        Predefined Ranks list in the dialog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever possible, it is highly recommended that users choose a predefined rank rather than
        create a custom rank.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a limit to the number of custom ranks available between each predefined rank. When
        custom ranks can no longer be added between the predefined ranks, the status bar message
        <em>Unable to assign Rank</em> will appear.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Ranks must be defined in the tree definition before they can
          be entered as nodes in either a tree or form. For example, the city of Lawrence can not be
          added under Douglas County in a Geography tree if the tree definition does not include a rank
          for City.
