<p>Both Simple Search and Query may return groups of records. These returns can be named and saved as a Record Set, by clicking the <img src="../../images/record_sets_new_20.png" alt="record set" width="20" height="20" />(Record Set) button in the results bar. </p>
<p>The default permissions that Specify ships with allow Guest users to View the Record Sets, but not modify, add or delete them. All other users can use Record Sets in their entirety.</p>
<p><strong><a name="rs_create" id="rs_create"></a>Creating a Record Set </strong></p>
<p>Record Sets are created from the records in a results window of a Query or Simple Search. From within the results window:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click a single record, then click the <img src="../../images/record_sets_new_20.png" alt="record set" width="20" height="20" /> (Record Set) button to create a Record Set with a single record.</li>
  <br />
  <li>Command (for Mac) or Cntl (for PC) + click several records, then click the <img src="../../images/record_sets_new_20.png" alt="record set" width="20" height="20" /> (Record Set) button to create a Record Set that includes the selected records.</li>
  <br />
  <li>Click the <img src="../../images/record_sets_new_20.png" alt="record set" width="20" height="20" /> (Record Set) button without selecting any records, (or click the <em>Select All</em> button at the bottom of the results,) to create a Record Set from all the records.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><a name="record_set_add" id="record_set_add"></a>Adding records to a Record Set</strong></h3>
<p>Drop a Record Set onto another Record Set to merge them. Any duplicate records will be automatically removed. </p>
<p>Records can be added to a Record Set by selecting them from a results window and clicking the <img src="../../images/record_sets_dark_20.png" alt="record set" width="20" height="20" /> (Record Set) button at the bottom of the results. The <em>Choose a Record Set</em> dialog will appear:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select a Record Set name in the list and click the <em>OK</em> button to add the selected records to the existing Record Set.</li>
  <br />
  <li>Click the <em>New</em> button to create a new Record Set</li>
  <br />
  <li>Click <em>Cancel</em> to close the dialog. </li>
</ul>
<p>Or, select the records to enable the <img src="../../images/record_sets_dark_20.png" alt="record set" width="20" height="20" /> (Record Set) button, then drag the button to an existing record set on the side bar to add the records to the existing record set. The existing record set and the new records must be from the same table to be compatible. As the button is dragged toward the side bar any existing record sets that can accept the new records will display a colored band.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><a name="rs_use" id="rs_use"></a>Using Record Sets</strong></h3>
<p>Record Sets can also be dragged and dropped on other Sidebar items. Slightly drag the Record Set within the Sidebar, and any form, Interaction or Plugin that can accept the Record Set will display a colored outline. When the Record Set has been dragged to the correct spot over the Sidebar item a triangle will appear within the outline. Items that can accept a Record Set will vary depending on the Record Set type. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Data Entry the Record Set type must match the form type to open the records. For example, a Collecting Event Record Set  dropped on the Collecting Event Sidebar button will open a Collecting Event form that includes all the records in the Record Set. The records can then be stepped through using the navigation control at the bottom of the form.</li>
  <br />
  <li>In Interactions a Collection Object Record Set can be dropped on a Loan, Gift or Information Request. This will activate a dialog for choosing Prep Types from the Record Set to include in the Loan, Gift or Information Request.</li>
  <br />
  <li>In Plugins  a Locality Record Set can be dropped on  GEOLocate to georeference the records, or on Google Earth to plot the records on a map.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="rs_menu" id="rs_menu"></a>Record Set Context Menu</h3>
<p>Right-button-click on a Record Set to perform the following functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rename</strong> activates a text field for the   Record Set name in the side bar. Type the new name into the text field, then type the <em>Return</em> key to deactivate the text field.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete</strong> will delete the Record Set and remove it from the side bar.</li>
  <li><strong>View</strong> opens a new results window listing the records in the set. The Record Set view will not be a duplicate of the original search results window, but is meant to provide a  list of the records in the Record Set. The results window status bar offers additional functionality.</li>

<p>Records can also be selected within the window and added to another record set by clicking the <img src="../../images/record_sets_dark_20.png" alt="record set" width="20" height="20" /> (Record Set) button at the bottom of the results window and choosing a record set from the resulting dialog or dragging the <img src="../../images/record_sets_dark_20.png" alt="record set" width="20" height="20" /> (Record Set) button and dropping it on the desired record set in the side bar.</p>
