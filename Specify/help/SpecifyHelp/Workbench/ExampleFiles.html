<h2>Examples </h2>
<p>Example files and images are included with the WorkBench and can be imported for testing the various functions of the WorkBench. These are located in the Examples/Files directory. 
Each file includes several columns representing  different discipline specific fields. Each file also includes columns that do not map in the WorkBench Data Set Mapping Editor 
to illustrate the operation of this function. The resulting Data Sets from these files will exhibit different functionality 
in the BioGeomancer(<img src="../images/biogeomancer16x16.png" alt="biogeo" width="16" height="16">) and Google Earth (<img src="../images/GoogleEarth16x16.png" alt="ge" width="16" height="16">) tools. The features of each file are listed below by discipline.  The Ichthyology and Botany files have been imported into the WorkBench at startup.</p>
