<h2><strong><a name="import_export" id="import_export"></a>Import/Export</strong> Forms and Reports</h2>
<p>At this time Specify 6 does not include a Form Editor, as was found in Specify 5. The forms have been created programmatically to be extremely flexible and can be exported as XML and either edited by on-site staff or emailed to the Specify staff for assistance with form editing and customization. Forms are imported and exported using the Resource Import/Export dialog. Forms are exported as a set of forms, or form set, and are imported back into Specify as a form set as well. </p>
<p>Reports can also be imported and exported through the use of this tool. Reports are created from a query and export as a file that contains both the report and query. Reports are typically exported so they may be imported back into Specify  either by a new user or at a different level, allowing the reports to be shared within the community.</p>
<p><a name="import_nonspecify_report" id="import_nonspecify_report"></a>Users that can program in MySQL can create their own report for inclusion in Specify 6. Create the Report including this Report Query Where clause: &quot;where co.collectionobjectid $P!{itemnum} . Also include a parameter named &quot;itemnum&quot;. </p>
<p>Choose <em>System &gt; Resource Import/Export</em> to open the Import/Export tool. This Import/Export tool (and menu) is only availabe to Administrators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tab at the top of the tool allows the choice of importing/exporting either a Form Set or Report.</p>
<p>Importing and exporting is based on the same levels that are found within the institution, with the addition of a <em>System</em> level:</p>
<ul>
  <li>System</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Institution</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Division</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Discipline</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Collection</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Group</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Users</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>For each level the imported resource (form or report) is made available to other users at the same level as well as all levels below it. This is based on the permissions for the person importing. Resources imported at the bottom (User) level will be made available to the user only. At the Group level the resource is accessible to all users within the collection that are part of the same Group based as the individual user. </p>
<p>Forms are named for the Table they represent. For instance, the Collection Object form is named CollectionObject. As stated above, forms are imported and exported as a form set. When the Form tab is active the window splits to show the name of the form set on the left and the individual forms that are included in the set on the right. When a form is imported back into Specify it can either be added to the forms available within Specify by naming it a unique name, or replace an existing form by importing it back into Specify as the same name. Specify walks up the tree starting at the User level when loading forms for display within Specify. In other words, if a CollectionObject form is located at both the User level and the Discipline level, Specify will find and display only the User level form.</p>
<p>Resources can not be imported or exported from the <em>System</em> level. It holds the set of resources that Specify ships with and can be used to restore the resources if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Export</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose the level at which the resource is located.</li>
  <li>Choose  the resource to export.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Export</em> button.</li>
  <li>Choose a name and path in the resulting file system dialog for the exported resource to be located.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Import</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose the level to import the resource into.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Import</em> button.</li>
  <li>Choose the file to import from the resulting file system dialog. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><a name="revert_forms" id="revert_forms"></a>Revert</strong></p>
<p>Revert will delete ALL files that have ever been imported. The Uploader tool remembers the files that Specify shipped with at each level and reverts back to those files. If the Uploader recognizes imported files the <em>Revert</em> button will become enabled. </p>
