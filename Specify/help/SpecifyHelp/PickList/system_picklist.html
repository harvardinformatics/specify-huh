<p>Any field in which data is limited to a controlled vocabulary is called a <em>Pick List</em>. Specify ships with many fields already formatted as pick lists and populated with choices. For example, the Agent Title  field is pre-populated with the choices of Asst. Director, Curator, Dr., Mr., Mrs., and Ms. </p>
<p>Pick lists that are predefined within Specify are called System Pick Lists. New pick lists created by the user are referred to as User Defined Pick Lists. The following text explains the steps needed to edit a System Pick List. For information about adding or editing User Defined Pick Lists please refer to <a href="../PickList/Pick_List.html">User Defined Pick Lists.</a></p>

<h3><a name="system_pl" id="system_pl"></a>Editing  System Pick List</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>System Pick Lists can not be deleted or added within Specify, but can be edited in a limited capacity. Only Pick Lists with definable items can be edited. The name and type of system pick list can not be edited. </p>
  <p>Editing is performed in the Pick List Editor. </p>
  <p>Choose <em>System &gt; Collection Setup &gt; Configuration</em>  then click on <em>Pick List Editor</em> in the side bar menu. The Configuration tool (and menu) is only available to users in a Manager  group.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose a Pick List from the System Pick Lists at the top of the dialog.    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Click the <img src="../../images/Edit-2-16x16.png" width="16" height="16" /> (edit) button at the bottom of the list.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A second dialog will open for configuring the Pick List. The Pick List items are located at the bottom of the dialog. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Click the <img src="../../images/add.png" width="16" height="16" />(plus) button to add an item.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Click the <img src="../../images/delete.png" width="16" height="16" /> (delete) button to delete an item.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Click <span class="MichaelsChanges">arrow </span>buttons in the Navigation Controls to navigate through the items. </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Type a Title</strong>  will appear in the pick list.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Type a Value</strong>  is stored in the data base. It is a good practice not to use spaces in the Value and to abbreviate where possible. The Value exists so that at a later date the Title can be edited without needing to change the Value in the data base. Values should not be edited.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Click the <em>Save</em> button.</li>
  </ul>
