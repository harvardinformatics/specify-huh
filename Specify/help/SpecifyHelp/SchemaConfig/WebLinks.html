       Many web sites currently offer services that Collection Managers find useful when entering
      or evaluating data within a collection. Specify includes a Web Link Editor that configures
      links to web addresses. A button can then be placed on a form that will launch a browser and connect to the web address.</p>
    <p>
       At this time web links can not be inserted into forms automatically without editing the form
      manually. To do this the form will need to be exported out of Specify, edited and imported
      back into Specify. For this reason, Web Links should NOT be defined until the new form
      containing the Web Link has been imported into Specify.
    For help inserting the web links on a form please contact the Specify team at <a href="mailto:specify@ku.edu">specify@ku.edu</a>.</p>
<p>
       There are 4 types of web links:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>1</strong>. A <strong>Global</strong> web link is not linked to a table or field, but offers a prompt
        for a value before launching.      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.</strong> A <strong>Field</strong> link sends values from an existing field to a web service, causing
        it to open to a specific page based on those values.      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.</strong> A <strong>New Field</strong> link creates a new field (not included in the Specify
        Schema) and launches the web site to a specific page based on the data in that field when the
        <em>Web Link</em> button is pushed. This link would require that a field be added to a form
        next to the web link button.      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.</strong> A <strong>URL Field</strong> link allows a URL to be entered into a field, then launches
        a browser and connects to the URL by clicking the web link button. This link would require
        that a field be added to a form next to the web link button.      </p>
    </blockquote>
<p>
       Web links are configured using the Web Link Editor. It is highly recommended that the description
      (Desc) field in the Web Link Editor contain a description of exactly how the web link
      should work. This will be very useful when editing a form to include the web link as well as
      for future reference.

       Web Link Editor    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Web links are available for both Tables and Fields.    </p>
      <p>
        <u>Table</u> (<em>System &gt; Schema Configuration</em>), choose a
        table from the Tables list and click the <em>...</em> (dialog) button next to the <em>Web Links</em>        button. This editor can create a Global, Field or New Field link.      </p>
      <p>        <u>Field</u>
        (<em>System &gt; Schema Configuration</em>), choose a table from the Tables list and a field
        from the Fields list.Then, in the Field pane, click <em>Field Format Type</em> button and
        choose <em>Web Link</em> from the resulting list. This editor can create any of the web link
        types and is the only editor that can complete the creation of the URL Field link.      </p>
      <p>
        Once a web link is created it will display in the Pick List next to the ... (dialog) button.
        When creating a Global, Field or New Field web link the name of the web link will need to be
        chosen from the pick list to link to the field. When you create a URL Field link, the pick
        list will need to say 'none'.

    <a name="web_global" id="global"></a>Global Web Link    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A global link is useful when a field does not exist for the information required by a web
        service. It can be created in the System Configuration (<em>System &gt; Collection Setup &gt;
        Configuration</em>) or the Schema Configuration (<em>System &gt; Schema Configuration</em>).      </p>
      <p>
        1. Open the Web Link Editor by one of the methods above.      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Buttons at the bottom of the dialog offer the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><img height="16" alt="edit" src="../../images/Edit-2-16x16.png" width="16"> (edit) opens
            the Web Link Editor for editing a saved web link.
          </li>
          <li><img height="16" alt="delete" src="../../images/delete.png" width="16"> (delete) removes
            the web link. </li>
          <li><img height="16" alt="add" src="../../images/add.png" width="16"> (add) opens the Web Link
            Editor for creating a new Web Link. </li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        2. Click the <img height="16" src="../../images/add.png" width="16">&nbsp;(add) button to add a
        web link, or the <img height="16" src="../../images/Edit-2-16x16.png" width="16">&nbsp;(edit)
        button to edit a web link. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name</strong> refers to the Name of the web link. </li>
        <li> Type the URL into the <strong>Base URL</strong> field. </li>
        <li> Type the name you wish the prompt to use at the end of the url with brackets on each end.
          Example; &lt;climate&gt;        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The name of the prompt will appear in both a Name and Title field in the editor. The Title
        is editable and will display for the prompt. The Name will appear in the web link
        lists.      </p>
      <p>
        More than one prompt can be added by simply adding brackets; they do not require a
        separator.      </p>

      <p>
        A Field Link is used to link to web services that return data based on values
        from within the Specify database. For instance, FishBase returns information about a particular specimen based
        on the current genus and species information. This web link would be configured to include the genus and
        species field from a record and launch to the exact page rather than the Fish Base home page.    </p>

      <p> Create a New Field Link by following the steps above (Field Link), with one variation,
        Rather than typing the name of a field into the brackets type &lt;this&gt;. The name &lt;this&gt;
        will appear in the Fields window. This link is useful when a field for required link
        information is not included in the Specify Schema. This link would require that a field and
        button be added to a form. Users would type the information into the field, then click the
        button and launch the site to a particular page based on data sent to the site. </p>

      <p>
        Once the Web Link Editor is open fill in a name for the web link.
      </p>
      <p> In the Base URL text field type type &lt;this&gt;. 'this' will appear in the
        Name field of the Fields window. Specify will then know to take whatever is typed into the
        box and use it as an URL to launch a web site. </p>
      <p>
        The most important step to remember when creating an URL Field web link is to choose
        <em>none</em> as the web link pick list (middle button) next to the Web Link Format Type.
