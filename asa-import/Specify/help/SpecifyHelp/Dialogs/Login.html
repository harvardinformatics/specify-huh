<h2>Starting Specify</h2>
  <p>When Specify is launched it automatically checks for updates and allows the user to choose to download and install the update, then provides a  login mechanism. </p>
  <h3><img src="../../images/login.png"   alt=""/><a name="specify_login" id="specify_login"></a> Login to Specify</h3>
  <p>The security for Specify 6 uses both a Master Username and Password, which accesses  the MySQL Database, as well as a User Username and Password, which in return gains access to the Specify application. Specify uses only one Master Username and Password for all users, but encrypts the Master password with the User information, creating an encrypted string. This allows the Master information to become unique for each user. </p>
<p>In review, the following information is required to log in to Specify the first time.</p>
<ul>
    <li>User Username</li>
    <li>User Password</li>
    <li>Master Username</li>
    <li>Master Password</li>
    <li>Encryption Key, (Encrypted Username / Password )</li>
</ul>
<p>The login tool remembers the usernames and passwords of the last person to log in. It is important to note that the User Username and Password is stored on the users machine. This allows the Login tool to automatically fill in the Username, Password and encrypted Master. To log in to another machine the user will need their username and password and a valid Encryption Key, just as they did when logging in for the first time.</p>
<p>For more information regarding the Specify 6 security model please refer to <a href="../security/db_security.html">Specify Security.</a></p>
<p>The log in process includes dialog windows for entering both types of information. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/login1a.png" width="360" height="146" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Users with an existing Username and Password can simply log in using the correct fields. </p>
  <p>Users that are logging in for the first time, or wish to login to a different database than they were previously using must  click the<img src="../../images/Forward16x16.png"  /><em>More Information</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/login2a.png" width="360" height="230" /></p>
<p>When the Specify  database is created using the Specify  Wizard the Database and Server information should be included in the dialog. If the Database and Server information does not appear in the dialog and you are running Specify on a local machine please consult your IT administrator. If  more than one Database and Server are available the dialog will list all the choices for both.</p>
<p>If you are accessing a remote server, you will need to fill in the Database and Server name (this can be an IP address if the IP is 'Static'). </p>
<p>Users needing to create their encrypted Master Username and Password should click the  <em>Configure Master Key ...</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/login4.png" width="360" height="92" /></p>
<p>The Master Source information refers to the location that the encryption is stored.</p>
  <p>At this time Specify does not support obtaining an encryption key from a web service, so choose<em> Encryption key stored in local preferences.</em></p>
<p>Encrypted Username / Password refers to the string that results when the Master Username and Password are Encrypted (using the User Username and Password). This can be created by the IT administrator when a new user is created in the Specify application, then given to the user, or it can be created by clicking the <em>Generate Master</em> ... button.</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/login5.png" width="360" height="162" /></p>
<p>Type in the information for both passwords and click the <em>Generate</em> button. The <em>Show Password</em> button can be used to turn off the encryption characters and show the actual textual information. </p>
  <p><img src="../../images/login3.png" width="360" height="92" /></p>
<p>The encrypted Master Username and Password now appears in the Encrypted box.</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/login2.png" width="360" height="230" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The first login dialog is now presented. Click the <em>Login</em> button to complete the process.</p>
