<p>Specify has utilized the power of iReport 3.0, an open source report writing software package, by changing the original iReport version to interact with Queries created in Specify 6 and  the Specify 6 database. The resulting application is called <A href="../ReportsLabels/specifyireports.html">SpecifyiReport.</a></p>
<p>The following documentation discusses the Report components on the reports side bar and assumes that reports have already been created using SpecifyiReport. To access  these  click the <IMG height="20" alt="" src="../../images/Reports20x20.png" width=20 /> Reports button on the task bar.
</p><p>When reports are created they can be saved at either a User or Discipline level, limiting access to the User only or making the report available to all Collections within the Discipline. Reports can also be exported and reimported at a different level, thus granting a greater access and use of the report. Please refer to <A href="../Import/import_export.html">Importing and Exporting Resources</a> for more information.
</p><p>The permissions for Report includes SpecifyiReport. The default permissions that Specify ships with allow Guest users to View the reports, but not modify, add or delete them. All other users can use forms in their entirety.
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><u><a name="report_sidebar" id="report_sidebar"></a>Side Bar Items</u></h3>
<p>It is important to note that the distinction between reports and labels in Specify 6  is purely an organizational function allowing users to list these items separately on the Sidebar. Reports and labels are created in exactly the same way in iReports and run and print the same from within Specify.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><u>Run Report</u> also refers to labels and invoices.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drag a report, label or invoice and drop it on this 
  button or click the button to open a dialog and choose a report/label/invoice 
  from the resulting dialog, or drag a record set onto a report/label/invoice in 
  the side bar.<br />
  </li><li>If the Prompt box was selected in the report query a 
  dialog will open allowing the query expressions to be edited before running 
  the report.<br />
  </li><li>The report will display in the Workspace. A tool bar at the top of the Workspace offers buttons for saving, printing and view.</li>
</ul>

      <ul>
        <li>PDF (.pdf); this file format has the best 
        output. 
        </li><li>RTF (.rtf); this format is typically read in a 
        text viewer. 
        </li><li>ODT (.odt) 
        </li><li>HTML (.html); this will view on a web site, but 
        depending on the layout of the report a PDF may provide a better display 
        of the report.
